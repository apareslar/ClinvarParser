This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The Q232X variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret Q232X as a pathogenic variant.

9	Pathogenic	Jan 07, 2019	This sequence change replaces cysteine with tyrosine at codon 282 of the HFE protein (p.Cys282Tyr). The cysteine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between cysteine and tyrosine. This variant is present in population databases (rs1800562, ExAC 5%). This is a common, low penetrance variant that is known to contribute to hemochromatosis when homozygous or present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE. As many as 90% of individuals of European descent who are affected with hemochromatosis are homozygous for this variant (PMID: 16132052, 26153218, 26365338). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 9). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts a disulfide bond in the Å’Â±3 domain of the HFE protein and impairs interaction of HFE with beta2-microglobulin, resulting in a block in intracellular transport and loss of cell surface expression of the Cys282Tyr variant protein (PMID: 9162021, 9356458). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic (low penetrance).

9	Pathogenic	Jan 21, 2019	The C282Y variant in the HFE gene is the most common pathogenic variant associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (Cezard et al., 2014; Feder et al., 1996). The C282Y variant is observed in 7,275/126,464 (5.7%%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The C282Y variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Functional studies have shown that the C282Y results in a protein that does not reach the cell surface and is subject to accelerated degradation (Waheed et al., 1997). We interpret C282Y as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329362.6	HFE	-

9	Pathogenic	Mar 30, 2016	The c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) missense variant is widely recognized as one of the two most common disease-causing variants in the HFE gene. Cys282Tyr homozygotes account for 80-85% of typical patients with Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH). However, the majority of individuals who are homozygous for this variant do not develop the disease (GeneReviews, Kowdley et al., 2012; Ramrakhiani and Bacon, 1998; and Morrison et al., 2003). In summary, this variant c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) meets our criteria for a Pathogenic classification. We have confirmed this finding in our laboratory using Sanger sequencing.

9	Pathogenic	Jun 05, 2017	The c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant in the HFE gene in the homozygous state has been reported as a common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis with high penetrance of biochemically defined iron overload but low penetrance of clinically defined iron overload [OMIM:613609.0001; PMID 8896549, 10381492, 18199861]. This variant has been detected at high frequency in the ExAC population database (up to 5% in Europeans) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/6-26093141-G-A). Cysteine at amino acid position 282 of the HFE protein is highly conserved in mammals and computer-based algorithms predict this p.Cys282Tyr change to be deleterious. This variant is classified as pathogenic.<BR>Apparent homozygosity of this variant may be caused by the presence of the mutant allele on both alleles of this individual, or the presence of a mutant allele on one allele and an exonic deletion on the opposite allele. Copy number variant (CNV) analysis or segregation analysis is necessary to assess the apparent homozygosity status of this variant.

9	Pathogenic	Apr 05, 2019	The HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) missense variant is one of the two most common and well-studied pathogenic variants associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), with approximately 80-87% of HH type 1 patients of European origin being homozygous or compound heterozygous for this variant (Feder et al. 1996; Gallego et al. 2015; Press et al. 2016). Disease penetrance for the p.Cys282Tyr variant carriers is variable (Beutler et al. 2002; Pedersen et al. 2009; Gurrin et al. 2009), with homozygotes being at a greater risk for iron overload than compound heterozygotes (Seckington et al. 2015; Gallego et al. 2015). The p.Cys282Tyr variant affects HFE protein activity by preventing the formation of a disulfide bridge in the alpha-3 domain, which impairs the beta-2-microglobulin interaction and prevents the protein from reaching the cell surface (Feder et al. 1997). The p.Cys282Tyr variant has a frequency of 5% to 7% in Caucasians (Press et al. 2016) and is reported at a frequency of 0.06407 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. This allele frequency is high but is consistent with estimates of disease prevalence and reduced penetrance. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Cys282Tyr variant is classified as pathogenic for hereditary hemochromatosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

10	Pathogenic	Jun 14, 2016	The c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) variant is well described in the literature as a pathogenic variant with significantly reduced penetrance (Seckington et al. 2015). Only two percent or fewer of individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for the p.His63Asp variant are expected to develop clinical symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) (Gochee et al. 2002; Gurrin et al. 2009; Gallego et al. 2015). The p.His63Asp variant was first reported by Feder et al. (1996) in a cohort of 178 HH patients in one homozygote, eight compound heterozygotes, and nine heterozygotes where a second variant was not observed. This variant was also found in 51 of 308 control chromosomes in this study. The p.His63Asp variant is reported at a frequency of 0.25234 in the Iberian Population in Spain in the 1000 Genomes Project. This allele frequency is high but is consistent with disease prevalence, reduced penetrance, and a mild phenotype. Based on the evidence, the p.His63Asp variant is classified as a pathogenic variant with significantly reduced penetrance for hereditary hemochromatosis.

10	Pathogenic	Oct 15, 2018	The H63D variant in the HFE gene is a common variant associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. When present in the homozygous state, H63D is associated with elevated serum transferrin and transferrin saturation, but the presence of clinical symptoms and iron overload was not increased compared to individuals without an HFE variant (Gochee et al., 2002; Feder et al., 1996). The H63D variant may be more clinically relevant when present in the compound heterozygous state with the C282Y variant, although most individuals do not develop clinical hemochromatosis symptoms, even if they have biochemical parameters consistent with hemochromatosis (Gurrin et al., 2009; Seckington and Powell, 2015). The H63D variant is observed in 18,253/126,698 alleles (14.4%) from individuals of European background, and 30,021/277,190 global alleles (10.8%) including 1992 homozygous control individuals, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The H63D variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Functional studies have shown that H63D disrupts normal protein function (Nandar et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2011). We interpret H63D as a pathogenic variant.

The histidine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between histidine and aspartic acid. This variant is present in population databases (rs1799945, ExAC 14%). This is a very common, low penetrance variant that is known to contribute to hemochromatosis when present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE. An estimated 1.5% of individuals of European descent who are affected with hemochromatosis are homozygous for this variant (PMID: 11479183), however, penetrance of the homozygous genotype is very low and is associated with variable phenotypes (PMID: 24729993, 11399207, 16132052, 11358905). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 10). Experimental studies have shown that while this variant does not affect the localization of the protein on the cell surface or normal HFE interaction with its partner molecules (PMID: 9356458, 9162021), it does disrupt the ability to inhibit cellular iron release (PMID: 12429850), and causes partial loss of HFE function and increased hepatic iron loading in mice (PMID: 14673107).

11	Uncertain significance	Dec 15, 2018	This sequence change replaces serine with cysteine at codon 65 of the HFE protein (p.Ser65Cys). The serine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between serine and cysteine. This is a common variant that has been suggested to contribute to hemochromatosis when present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE (PMID: 10194428), but other studies have not found this association (PMID: 10660483, 19159930). For more information about the molecular genetics associated with hemochromatosis, see PMID: 16132052. Because the clinical significance of this variant is unclear at this time, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

11	Uncertain significance	Jul 27, 2017	The HFE c.193A>T (p.Ser65Cys) variant is a missense variant that has been reported to be enriched in individuals affected with hereditary hemochromatosis as compared to unaffected individuals in two studies (Mura et al. 1999; Holmstrom et al. 2002). The authors suggested that the p.Ser65Cys variant is associated with a mild phenotype, resulting in a lower degree of iron overload as compared to common pathogenic variants in the HFE gene. Two functional studies have reported that the p.Ser65Cys variant alone has no significant influence on iron status markers (Pedersen et al. 2009; Aranda et al. 2010), and Bacon et al. (2011) and Alves et al. (2016) discuss that the p.Ser65Cys variant is generally not associated with iron loading unless seen in a compound heterozygous state with either the p.Cys282Tyr or p.His63Asp variant. The p.Ser65Cys variant is reported at a frequency of 0.03846 in the British of England and Scotland population of the 1000 Genomes Project, which is consistent with estimates of disease prevalence and penetrance. Although p.Ser65Cys variant is widely reported in the literature as the third most common variant associated with HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (Seckington et al. 2015), the functional evidence suggests that this variant may not contribute to the mechanism of disease. Based on this conflicting evidence, the p.Ser65Cys is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for hereditary hemochromatosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

23	Likely pathogenic	May 25, 2017	The p.Ala875Thr variant was previously reported in trans with another WDR35 variant, c.2891del; p.Pro964fs, identified by whole exome analysis in a child with Sensenbrenner syndrome also known as cranioectodermal dysplasia (Gilissen 2010). At nine years of age that patient had small thorax, pectus excavatum, rhizomelic shortening of limbs, short and broad hands, bilateral sandal gap between first and second toe, hypertelorism, low-set simple ears and thin hair (Gilissen 2010). Additionally, functional in vitro study showed that p.Ala875Thr variant impaired IFT-A-mediated cargo transport to cilia (Fu 2016). The p.Ala875Thr variant (rs267607175) is not listed in gene-specific variant databases, nor has it been previously identified in our laboratory. It is listed in ClinVar (Variation ID 23) and it is listed in the Genome Aggregation Consortium (gnomAD) browser with an overall allele frequency of 0.0004 percent (identified on 1 European chromosome out of all 246,026 analyzed chromosomes). Alanine 875 is highly conserved considering 11 species (Alamut software v2.9.0) but computational programs predict mixed effect of this variant on the protein (SIFT: tolerated, PolyPhen-2: probably damaging and MutationTaster: disease causing).

24	Pathogenic	Oct 09, 2017	The c.337_338delGAinsTTT variant has been published previously in association with PHARC disease (Fiskerstrand et al., 2010). It causes a frameshift starting with codon Aspartic acid 113, changes this amino acid to a Phenylalanine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 15 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Asp113PhefsX15. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. c.337_338delGAinsTTT is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). In summary, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000617636.1	ABHD12	-

28	Uncertain significance	Oct 20, 2017	The ZNF513 c.1015T>C (p.Cys339Arg) variant has been reported in a homozygous state in four siblings from a consanguineous family with retinitis pigmentosa (Li et al. 2010). The unaffected parents and three unaffected siblings were heterozygous for this variant. This variant was absent from 242 control chromosomes, but is reported at a frequency of 0.001637 in the South Asian population from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. In zebrafish, the p.Cys339Arg variant showed reduced rescue of retinal phenotype compared to wildtype (31% vs. 86%). The evidence for this variant is limited, therefore the p.Cys339Arg variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but is suspicious for pathogenicity for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.

29	Pathogenic	Oct 19, 2018	The HOGA1 c.944_946delAGG (p.Glu315del) variant results in an inframe deletion. Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Glu315del variant has been identified in a total of 38 individuals with primary hyperoxaluria including 15 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes (Belostotsky et al. 2010; Monico et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2012; Hopp et al. 2015; Pitt et al. 2015; Williams et al. 2015). The second variant carried by the compound heterozygotes is either a missense or splice_region variant. The p.Glu315del variant was absent from 113 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.008967 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Expression of the p.Glu315del variant protein in CHO cells revealed that the protein was mislocalized and retained no measurable activity (Riedel et al. 2012). Expression analysis in HEK293 cells demonstrated the p.Glu315del variant protein was unstable and was only detected in the presence of 26S proteasome inhibitor (MacDonald et al. 2016). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Glu315del variant is classified as pathogenic for primary hyperoxaluria.

36	Pathogenic	Dec 13, 2018	The R437X pathogenic variant in the FAM161A gene has been reported previously in multiple unrelated individuals with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another disease-causing variant (Langmann et al., 2010; Rose et al., 2015; Van Shil et al., 2015). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The R437X variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.

36	Pathogenic	Sep 19, 2017	The FAM161A c.1309A>T (p.Arg437Ter) variant has been reported in at least five studies in 18 individuals with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, including 12 in a homozygous state, five in a compound heterozygous state, and one in a heterozygous state in whom a second variant was not identified (Langmann et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2014; Rose et al. 2015; Van Schil et al. 2015; van Huet et al. 2015). These patients were unrelated, except for two sets of siblings who were homozygous for the p.Arg437Ter variant (Van Schil et al. 2015; Rose et al. 2015). The p.Arg437Ter variant was absent from 400 control chromosomes and is reported at a frequency of 0.00061 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg437Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

37	Pathogenic	Aug 07, 2018	The c.1355_1356delCA variant in the FAM161A gene has been reported previously in both the homozygous state, and in the compound heterozygous state with another FAM161A pathogenic variant, in several individuals with retinitis pigmentosa (Bandah-Rozenfeld et al., 2010; Venturini et al., 2014). This variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Threonine 452, changes this amino acid to a Serine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 3 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Thr452SerfsX3. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, with analysis of cultured lymphoblasts from affected individuals suggesting transcript degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Venturini et al., 2014). The c.1355_1356delCA variant is observed in 26/277,154 (0.0094%) global alleles in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.1355_1356delCA as a pathogenic variant.

The p.Glu526Lys variant was present in 3 of 1290 unrelated Turkish control chromosomes, absent from 1500 Caucasian control chromosomes, and is reported at a frequency of 0.000415 in the Other population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Based on the limited evidence, the p.Glu526Lys variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for primary microcephaly 2 with or without cortical malformations.

41	Likely pathogenic	Mar 22, 2018	The E526K variant in the WDR62 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in an individual withmicrocephaly, severe intellectual disability, abnormal EEG, disconjugate gaze, dysarthria, and prognathism (BilgÃ¼varet al., 2010) and in a patient with central nervous system anomalies referred for genetic testing at GeneDx. TheE526K variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 GenomesConsortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server), however, BilgÃ¼var et al. (2010) observed the E526K mutation in3/1290 Turkish control chromosomes, suggesting an allele frequency of 0.2% in this population. The E526K variantis a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residuesdiffer in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved acrossspecies. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. We interpretE526K as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000576907.4	WDR62	-

49	Uncertain significance	Oct 28, 2017	This sequence change replaces alanine with valine at codon 515 of the TBC1D24 protein (p.Ala515Val). The alanine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between alanine and valine. This variant is present in population databases (rs267607105, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported to segregate with familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy in several individuals within a family (PMID: 20727515, 27281533). All affected individuals in this family were compound heterozygous with another missense variant (p.Asp147His). This p.Ala515Val variant has also been reported to co-occur with other missense variants in individuals with early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy and multi-focal epilepsy (PMID: 27281533). However it was not reported whether the variants were on the same chromosome (in cis) or on the opposite chromosome (in trans). This variant is also known as c.1526C>T(p.Ala509Val). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 49). Experimental evidence suggests this variant results in impaired neurite growth and length compared to wildtype TBC1D24 protein (PMID: 20727515). This variant is located in the domain catalytic domain (TDLc) thought to be involved in neuroprotective properties in response to oxidative stress, however, functional data using oxidative stress response assay showed no influence on neuroprotective properties for this variant (PMID: 26668325). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may alter RNA splicing, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. In summary, this variant has been observed in affected individuals and segregating with disease in one family. In addition, functional evidence suggests it may alter some functional properties of TBC1D24 protein. However, additional experimental and/or segregation data is needed to determine Â¬â€ it's role is disease. Therefore, this change has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

54	Likely pathogenic	Aug 23, 2018	The C12orf65 c.210delA (p.Gly72AlafsTer13) variant results in a frameshift and is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Gly72AlafsTer13 variant has been reported in three studies and is found in four probands with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (COXPD) including in two in a homozygous state and in two siblings in a compound heterozygous state (Antonicka et al. 2010; Heidary et al. 2014; Wesolowska et al. 2015). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00032 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The p.Gly72AlafsTer13 variant resulted in reduced complex IV activity and reduced quantities of complex I, IV, and V in proband fibroblasts (Antonicka et al. 2010; Heidary et al. 2014; Wesolowska et al. 2015). Based on the potential impact of frameshift variants and available evidence, the p.Gly72AlafsTer13 variant is classified as pathogenic for combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

54	Pathogenic	Dec 19, 2016	The p.Gly72AlafsX13 variant in C12orf65 has been reported in 2 homozygous and 1 compound heterozygous probands with clinical features of combined oxidative phos phorylation deficiency type 7 (COXPD7) and segregated with disease in one additi onal affected sibling (Antonika 2010, Heidary 2013, Wesolowska 2015). This varia nt has also been identified in 1/8254 of European chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs57646274). This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, which alters the protein?s amino aci d sequence beginning at position 72 and leads to a premature termination codon 1 3 amino acids downstream. This alteration is then predicted to lead to a truncat ed or absent protein. Biallelic loss of function of the C12orf65 gene has been a ssociated with COXPD7. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for COXPD7 in an autosomal recessive manner based upon its occurr ence in affected individuals and predicted functional impact.

54	Pathogenic	Nov 28, 2018	The c.210delA pathogenic variant in the C12orf65 gene has been reported previously in association with optic atrophy and Leigh syndrome in individuals who were homozygous for c.210delA or compound heterozygous for c.210delA and another frameshift variant in C12orf65 (Antonicka et al., 2010; Wesolowska et al., 2015). The deletion causes a frameshift starting with codon Glycine 72, changes this amino acid to a Alanine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 13 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Gly72AlafsX13. This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation. We interpret c.210delA as a pathogenic variant.

55	Likely pathogenic	Sep 01, 2017	The CEP152 c.794A>C (p.Gln265Pro) missense variant has been reported in one study in which it was found in three individuals with microcephaly, with head circumferences between five and seven standard deviations below the mean, including in two individuals in a homozygous state and in one individual in a compound heterozygous state with a null variant on the second allele (Guernsey et al. 2010). The p.Gln265Pro variant was found in a heterozygous state in each of the unaffected parents of the affected individuals. The p.Gln265Pro variant was absent from 496 control chromosomes including 310 local Maritime control chromosomes and 186 European control chromosomes from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) (Guernsey et al. 2010). The variant is reported at a frequency of 0.000027 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Transfection of the variant protein into human U2OS osteosarcoma-derived cells did not affect localization, with the variant protein being found in the centrosomes similarly to wild type. However, the Gln265 residue is highly conserved among vertebrates and is predicted to fall in a coiled-coiled region predicted to be disrupted by substitution of a proline residue (Guernsey et al. 2010). Based on the evidence, the c.794A>C (p.Gln265Pro) variant is classified as likely pathogenic for CEP152-related disorders.

55	Likely pathogenic	Feb 10, 2016	The Q265P variant has been reported previously, in both the homozygous and compound heterozygous state, in individuals with primary microcephaly (Guernsey et al., 2010). The Q265P variant was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 5,900 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. The Q265P variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore, this variant is likely pathogenic; however, the possibility that it is benign cannot be excluded.

62	Uncertain significance	Dec 19, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with arginine at codon 79 of the OPN1SW protein (p.Gly79Arg). The glycine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and arginine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894031, ExAC 0.1%). This variant has been observed in individuals with tritanopia (impaired blue-yellow color vision), including a family in which it appeared in both the heterozygous and homozygous state in affected individuals (PMID: 1531728, 25605338). However, it has a population frequency greater than that expected for a pathogenic variant in an autosomal dominant disease, and the current clinical and genetic evidence is not sufficient to determine whether variants in OPN1SW cause autosomal recessive disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 62). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Benign"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

117	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The CBS c.919G>A (p.Gly307Ser) variant is well described as a common pathogenic allele in individuals with homocystinuria of Celtic origin, accounting for 71% of disease associated alleles in Ireland, 21% in the UK and 8% in the US (Moat et al. 2004). The presence of a single allele almost always predicts non-responsiveness to pyroxidine therapy. The p.Gly307Ser variant has been reported in at least six studies in which it is found in a total of 44 individuals including 14 in a homozygous state (including two pairs of siblings), ten in a compound heterozygous state (four of whom were related), and 20 heterozygotes in whom a second allele has not yet been identified (Hu et al. 1993; Gallagher et al. 1995; Kim et al. 1997; Kelly et al. 2003; Moat et al. 2004; Stabler et al. 2013). The variant was also found in at least three unaffected heterozygous relatives. The variant was absent from 82 control chromosomes but is reported at a frequency of 0.00026 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies have demonstrated that the Gly307 residue is located in the catalytic site of the protein and results in the production of correctly assembled tetramers that are slightly unfolded with a shift towards unfolded intermediates. The catalytic activity of the p.Gly307Ser variant protein is completely abolished (Hu et al. 1993; Hnizda et al. 2012). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Gly307Ser variant is classified as pathogenic for homocystinuria. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

117	Pathogenic	Dec 15, 2015	The p.Gly307Ser variant in CBS has been reported in at least 3 homozygote and 1 compound heterozygote probands with homocystinuria and segregated with disease i n 5 affected family members (Hu 1993, Dawson 1996, Stabler 2013). In addition, i n vitro functional studies provide evidence that the variant leads to impaired p rotein function (Hu 1993, Hnizda 2012, Kozich 2010, Mayfield 2012). This variant has also been identified in 17/66640 of European chromosomes by the Exome Aggre gation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121964962). Alt hough this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, this va riant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for homocystinuria in an autosomal recessive manner (http://www.partners.org/personalizedmedicine/LMM) b ased upon its segregation in affected individuals and functional evidence.

117	Pathogenic	Dec 26, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with serine at codon 307 of the CBS protein (p.Gly307Ser). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glycine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121964962, ExAC 0.03%). This variant is clearly defined as a causative allele for homocystinuria and has been observed in multiple affected individuals (PMID: 8744616, 7506602, 7581402, 9889017, 23733603). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 117). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change significantly disrupts CBS protein structure and enzymatic activity (PMID: 20506325, 22267502). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant was found in 19/121292 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0001566, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic CBS variant (0.0030414). This variant has been reported in many affected individuals and functional study showed variant with <1% activity in comparison with WT (Kozich_2010). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

117	Pathogenic	Oct 11, 2018	The pathogenic G307S missense variant in the CBS gene is a common variant found on approximately 70% of alleles in patients of Celtic origin with homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency and is usually associated with a more severe non-B6 responsive phenotype (Urreizti et al., 2006). Functional studies shave shown that G307S is located in the catalytic site and leads to increased protein unfolding, a shift towards unfolded intermediates and a significant decrease in enzyme activity in comparison to wild-type (Kozich et al., 2010; Hnizda et al., 2012). Furthermore, while the G307S variant is observed in 39/126706 (0.03%) alleles from individuals of European (Non-Finnish) ancestry, there are no homozygous individuals present in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The G307S variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Finally, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function.

119	Pathogenic	Dec 27, 2019	This sequence change replaces alanine with valine at codon 114 of the CBS protein (p.Ala114Val). The alanine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between alanine and valine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121964964, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been observed in an individual with low cystathionine- beta synthase enzyme activity, findings that are highly specific for homocystinuria due to cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS) deficiency (PMID: 8353501). It has also been reported in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of cystathionine-beta synthase deficiency (PMID: 7762555) ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 119). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts CBS protein activity (PMID: 20490928, 22612060, 22267502, 22069143, 20506325). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

119	Pathogenic	Sep 16, 2016	p.Ala114Val (A114V) (GCG>GTG): c.341 C>T in exon 5 of the CBS gene (NM_000071.2). The A114V mutation in the CBS gene has been reported in at least 4 individuals in association with homocystinuria (Kozich et al.,1993; Sebastio et al., 1995). The A114V mutation is a conservative amino acid substitution, as these residues share similar properties, and are least likely to impact secondary structure. However, functional studies have shown A114V leads to protein misfolding and instability compared to wild-type alleles (Kozich et al., 2010; Hznida et al., 2012). Additionally, mutations in nearby residues (C109R, G116R) have been reported in association with homocystinuria, further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Finally, the A114V mutation was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project or with any significant frequency in the 1000 Genomes Project (McVean et al., 2012). In summary, A114V in the CBS gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.

120	Pathogenic	Jul 23, 2018	The CBS c.833T>C; p.Ile278Thr variant (rs5742905) is the most frequently reported variant associated with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria and has been observed in affected individuals in both the homozygous and compound heterozygous states (Gaustadnes 1999, Refsum 2004, Skovby 2010, Magner, 2011, and Sorensen 2016). Functional studies demonstrate that the p.Ile278Thr variant has decreased stability and severely reduced activity relative to wildtype protein (Kozich 2010, Hnizda 2012, and Mayfield 2012). The clinical presentation of p.Ile278Thr homozygotes has been described as mild, with many patients having thrombosis as their initial symptom (Skovby 2010). This variant is classified as pathogenic in ClinVar (ID: 120) and is found in the general population with an overall allele frequency of 0.08% (24/30774 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database. The isoleucine at codon 278 is moderately conserved, and computational analyses (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) predict that this variant is deleterious. Based on the available evidence, the p.Ile278Thr variant is considered to be pathogenic. References: Gaustadnes et al, Prevalence of congenital homocystinuria in Denmark.

120	Pathogenic	Dec 31, 2019	This sequence change replaces isoleucine with threonine at codon 278 of the CBS protein (p.Ile278Thr). The isoleucine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between isoleucine and threonine. This variant is present in population databases (rs5742905, ExAC 0.2%). This variant has been reported in multiple individuals affected with homocystinuria as a homozygous or as a compound heterozygous with a different deleterious variant; and it represents the most common cause of pyridoxine responsive homocystinuria (PMID: 1301198, 19819175, 25516723, 2056790, 20567906, 18805305, 7635485, 15146473, 7611293, 11434706, 8803779, 17072863, 9708897, 10364517). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 120). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes low to null activity and abnormal protein folding (PMID: 1301198, 22069143, 20506325, 22267502, 11359213).

120	Pathogenic	Jan 24, 2019	The p.Ile278Thr variant in CBS is one of the most commonly observed pathogenic v ariants in patients with homocystinuria (Moat 2004, Skovby 2010), has been ident ified in more than 150 patients as both homozygotes and in trans with several ad ditional pathogenic alleles, and segregated multiple affected relatives (Kluijtm ans 1999, CBS Mutation Database: http://cbs.lf1.cuni.cz/mutations.php). It has b een reported in ClinVar (Variation ID: 120). This has been identified in 0.14% ( 22/15362) of European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, ht tp://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs5742905); however there is a common inse rtion for which sequencing data mimics this variant, so this frequency may be in accurate. This variant was also demonstrated to lead to reduced enzymatic activi ty in vitro and animal studies (Gupta 2013). In summary, this variant meets crit eria to be classified as pathogenic for homocystinuria acting in a recessive man ner.

120	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The CBS c.833T>C (p.Ile278Thr) variant is the most common variant associated with homocystinuria, overall accounting for 25% of all pathogenic variants, including 29% of the variant alleles in the UK and 18% in the US. In the Netherlands it was shown to account for the majority of pathogenic variants for homocystinuria (Gaustadnes et al. 1999; Kluijtmans et al. 1999; Moat et al. 2004; Skovby et al. 2010). The p.Ile278Thr variant is associated with reduced CBS activity and responsiveness to vitamin B6 (Shih et al. 1995; Gaustadnes et al. 1999; Kluijtmans et al. 1999). Individuals who are homozygous for the p.Ile278Thr variant are generally mildly affected and tend to be diagnosed as adults (Gaustadnes et al. 2000; Skovby et al. 2010). Those who are compound heterozygous for the p.Ile278Thr variant have variable phenotypes, ranging from mild to severe disease (Kraus et al. 1999). The p.Ile278Thr variant is most commonly found in cis with an intronic insertion variant in the CBS gene, c.844ins68, which introduces a novel splice site, causing excision of the p.Ile278Thr variant itself, resulting in a nonpathogenic allele (Tsai et al. 1996). Thus, the frequency of the p.Ile278Thr allele in the general population is likely to be higher than the incidence of homocystinuria would indicate. The variant is reported at a frequency of 0.00353 in the African American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ile278Thr variant is classified as pathogenic for homocystinuria. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

120	Pathogenic	Jan 22, 2018	Variant summary: The CBS c.833T>C (p.Ile278Thr) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide that is located in the Pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzyme domain (InterPro). 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant (SNPsandGO not captured due to low reliability index). This variant was found in 24/30798 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0007793, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic CBS variant (0.0030414). The variant has been found as a compound heterozygous and homozygous allele in numerous CBSD patients. It is a known common pathogenic variant when NOT found in cis with c.844_845ins68. The complex c.[833T>C;844_845ins68] is a common polymorphism found in the general population (Franco 1998, Dutta 2005, Romano 2008). The insertion variant in the complex activates an alternate splicing site, which eliminates not only the inserted intronic sequences but also the c.833T>C mutation associated with this insertion (Tsai 1999). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

122	Likely pathogenic	Apr 13, 2017	This sequence change replaces glutamic acid with lysine at codon 144 of the CBS protein (p.Glu144Lys). The glutamic acid residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glutamic acid and lysine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121964966, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been reported to co-occur in cis with the p.Arg439Gln variant in three individuals affected with homocystinuria (PMID: 9156316, 12124992). This variant has also been reported to co-occur in combination or in trans with other pathogenic variants in individuals with homocystinuria (PMID: 12124992, 7611293, 10215408). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 122). Experimental studies have shown that this variant severely impairs CBS enzyme activity in bacterial and yeast but not in higher eukaryotic cell systems (PMID: 22267502, 20506325, 25331909). In summary, this variant is a rare missense change which has been reported in affected individuals. Â¬â€ Additional functional or genetic data are needed to fully substantiate the pathogenicity of this variant. Therefore, it has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

The variant was also identified in a heterozygous state in the unaffected parents and sister of one of the homozygous individuals (Kluijtmans et al. 1996). The compound heterozygotes all carried a second missense variant on the second allele (Lefaucheur et al. 2008; Cozar et al. 2011). The p.Asp444Asn variant was absent from 80 controls but is reported at a frequency of 0.00134 in the Latino population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Functional studies were performed using cultured fibroblasts from a patient and showed that the p.Asp444Asn variant was not stimulated by physiological levels of S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet; a protein which stimulates CBS activity) compared to control fibroblasts, and required increased levels for stimulation (Kluijtmans et al. 1996; Evande et al. 2002). In addition, a study by Hnizda et al. (2012) evaluated protein folding and suggested that C-terminal regulatory domain variants, including the p.Asp444Asn variant, increased protein structural stability and decreased flexibility. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Asp444Asn variant is classified as pathogenic for homocystinuria. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

126	Pathogenic	Sep 25, 2018	The D444N pathogenic variant in the CBS gene has been previously reported in multiple homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals with classical homocystinuria due to cystathione beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency (Kluijtmans et al., 1996; Maclean et al., 2002; De Lucca et al., 2004; Moat et al., 2004; Urreizti et al., 2006; Cozar et al., 2011; Martinez- Gutierrez et al., 2011; Alcaide et al., 2015). Additionally, D444N was not observed at any significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The D444N variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position within the C-terminal auto-inhibitory regulatory domain of the CBS enzyme. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect.Study of fibroblasts from a patient homozygous for D444N found enzyme activity in the heterozygous range, despite severely increased homocysteine levels and classic clinical manifestations of homocystinuria (Kluijtmans et al., 1996). Additionally, multiple expression studies have also shown that D444N results in a CBS enzyme with higher than expected residual activity compared to other pathogenic variants in the CBS gene (Mendes et al., 2014a; Mendes et al., 2014b; Alcaide et al., 2015). However, several functional studies have demonstrated that D444N disrupts CBS protein interaction with S-adenosylmethionine (also called SAM or AdoMet), a cofactor needed for CBS allosteric activation and protein stability, thus causing reduced CBS protein levels and impairing its ability to be properly activated by physiological levels of SAM (Kluijtmans et al., 1996; Evande et al., 2002; Scott et al., 2004; Prudova et al., 2006; Mendes et al., 2014a; Mendes et al., 2014b; Alcaide et al., 2015). Thus, D444N, belongs to the class of pathogenic variants in the CBS gene that demonstrate significant residual CBS activity by standard in vitro assays, but impair CBS enzyme function by disruption of proper regulation through SAM activation (Mendes et al., 2014a; Alcaide et al., 2015).

126	Pathogenic	Oct 30, 2017	Variant summary: The CBS c.1330G>A (p.Asp444Asn) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide that lies within the CBS domain (InterPro). 3/4 in silico tools predict a benign outcome for this variant (SNPsandGO not captured due to low reliability index). This variant was found in 65/192534 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0003376, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic CBS variant (0.0030414). The variant has been reported in numerous patients with CBS-related homocystinuria, including homozygous patients. Functional studies suggest that CBS expression and activity levels are similar to those found in heterozygous individuals, but binding with the necessary cofactor S-adenosylmethionine and the subsequent induction of CBS protein activity is impaired (Mendes_2013). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

The V168M mutation in the CBS gene has been reported as a heterozygous mutation in one individual with a clinical phenotype suggestive of homocystinuria (Kruger et al., 1995). Functional studies in yeast have also suggested that V168M results in a non-functional allele (Mayfield et al., 2012). Although, V168M results in a conservative amino acid substitution, it occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Mutations in the same residue (V168A) and in nearby residues (A155T A155V, A158V, C165Y, M173V, E176K) have been reported in association with homocystinuria, further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Furthermore, the V168M mutation was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.In summary, V168M in the CBS gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.

127	Uncertain significance	Dec 08, 2016	This sequence change replaces valine with methionine at codon 168 of the CBS protein (p.Val168Met). The valine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between valine and methionine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121964970, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been reported in a cell line from an individual supposedly with CBS deficiency, however, misclassification of pedigree relationships and clinical phenotype was suspected for this individual (PMID: 8528202). It has also been observed as compound heterozygous in an individual affected with hyperhomocysteinemia (Invitae). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 127). Experimental studies have shown that this variant results in reduced expression and loss of enzyme activity (PMID: 8528202, 22267502, 10531322, 20066033). In summary, this variant has been observed in the cell line of an individual with suspected homocystinuria, and has been shown to affect protein function. However, without additional genetic data, this variant has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

128	Pathogenic	Dec 26, 2019	This sequence change affects an acceptor splice site in intron 13 of the CBS gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs375846341, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another CBS variant in individuals affected with homocystinuria (PMID: 11359213, 1301198, 15365998, 20567906), and has been shown to segregate with disease in a family (PMID: 15146473). This variant is also known as IVS11-2A>C or p.W409_G453del in the literature. This variant is described as a founder mutation of European ancestry (PMID: 15365998). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 128). Experimental studies have shown that this splicing change causes a deletion of exon 14 and disrupts CBS activity (PMID: 1301198, 20490928, 20506325).

128	Pathogenic	Mar 27, 2017	Variant summary: The CBS c.1224-2A>C variant (alternatively also known as IVS11-2A>C) involves the alteration of a highly conserved intronic nucleotide in the canonical splice acceptor site in intron 13, and is expected to cause aberrant gene splicing. 5/5 splice prediction tools also predict abrogation of the splice acceptor site. Consistent to these predictions, this variant is shown to cause exon skipping resulting in an in-frame deletion of exon 12 (amino acids W408 to G453) (Kozick_1992); exon 12 is involved in encoding the CBS domain of the protein (InterPro). In addition, expression of this variant in bacterial (E. coli) system shows that this variant not only leads to abrogation of catalytic activity, but also non-responsiveness to chaperones used to treat the CBS deficiency (Orendac _2004, Kopecka_2011). This variant was found in 7/45474 control chromosomes from ExAC at a frequency of 0.0001539, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic CBS variant (0.0030414). This variant has been reported in several patients with CBS deficiency in homozygous as well as compound heterozygous with other pathogenic or potentially pathogenic variants including evidence of cosegregation with disease. It is predominantly found in patients from Central Europe, where it has been found on in average 14% of mutant alleles with evidence of founder effect (Linnebank_2004). Available patient and functional data indicate that this variant is likely a severe mutation. Multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases have classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as Pathogenic.

128	Pathogenic	Sep 21, 2018	The CBS c.1224-2A>C variant, which occurs in a canonical splice acceptor site, has been reported in seven studies and is found in a total of 33 individuals with homocystinuria, including three homozygotes, 28 compound heterozygotes, and two heterozygotes (Kozich et al. 1992; Janosik et al. 2001; Orendae et al. 2004; Linnebank et al. 2004; Magner et al. 2011; Karaca et al. 2014; Alcaide et al. 2015). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.0003 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The c.1224-2A>C variant was found to cause an in-frame deletion of exon 12 and result in an inactive protein (Kozich et al. 1992). Functional studies in E. coli confirmed that the c.1224-2A>C variant results in an inactive enzyme (Janosik et al. 2001; Orendae et al. 2004), and CBS activity in cultured skin fibroblasts from probands carrying this variant was significantly reduced compared to wild type (Janosik et al. 2001). Based on the collective evidence and the potential impact of splice acceptor variants, the c.1224-2A>C variant is classified as pathogenic for homocystinuria.

129	Uncertain significance	Nov 26, 2018	The CBS c.1265C>T (p.Pro422Leu) variant is a missense variant that has been reported in a compound heterozygous state in at least one individual with a mild form of homocystinuria characterized by high Hcy levels and episodic transient ischemic attacks but no external features or connective tissue disorders characteristic of the disease (Gaustadnes et al. 2010; Maclean et al. 2002). This variant was absent from 100 control alleles and is not reported in the 1000 Genomes Project, Exome Sequencing Project, Exome Aggregation Consortium, or Genome Aggregation Database despite its location of good sequencing coverage. It is therefore presumed to be rare. Functional studies of the variant, which is located in the regulatory domain, conducted in E. coli, CHO-K1 cells, and yeast suggest the p.Pro422Leu variant protein is expressed at the same level as the wild type protein, is thermodynamically stable, and does not show reduced catalytic activity; however, experiments investigating the variant's effect on regulation by S-adenosylmethionine, which is required for in vivo regulation of homocysteine levels, produced conflicting results (Maclean et al. 2002; Kozich et a. 2010; Majtan et al. 2010; Mayfield et al. 2012; Hnâ”œÂ¡zda et al. 2012; Melenovskâ”œÃ­ et al. 2015). The evidence for this variant is limited. The p.Pro422Leu variant is thus classified as of uncertain significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for homocystinuria.

129	Uncertain significance	Sep 06, 2017	A variant of uncertain significance has been identified in the CBS gene. The P422L variant has been reported in one patient with homocystinuria who harbored an additional variant in the CBS gene (Maclean et al., 2002). This variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). The P422L variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. However, while some functional studies studies suggest the presence of the P422L variant may alter protein interactions under various experimental conditions, it is not known whether these findings are biological or clinically relevant in vivo (Maclean et al., 2002; Mayfield et al., 2012).

Mutations in nearby residues (D198V, P200L) have been reported in association with homocystinuria, further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Furthermore, the T191M mutation was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.

137	Pathogenic	Oct 18, 2018	The c.225_235del11 variant has been reported previously as c.42_52del11 using alternate nomenclature in association with hearing loss (Li et al., 2010; Rehman et al., 2010; Bashir et al., 2013). The deletion causes a frameshift starting with codon Glycine 76, changes this amino acid to an Alanine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 150 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Gly76AlafsX150. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We consider this variant to be pathogenic.

139	Likely pathogenic	May 30, 2017	The c.1325_1326delTC variant in the SLC52A3 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state and in the presence of another heterozygous SLC52A3 variant, in two related individuals with clinical features that include hypotonia, brisk reflexes in the lower limbs, bulbar palsy, and respiratory difficulties (Green et al., 2010). The c.1325_1326delTC variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Leucine 442, changes this amino acid to a Arginine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 64 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Leu442ArgfsX64. This frameshift variant replaces the typical last 28 amino acid residues in the SLC52A3 protein with 63 different amino acid residues. This change is expected to alter the normal structure and function of the resultant protein. The c.1325_1326delTC variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). We interpret c.1325_1326delTC as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000583227.3	SLC52A3	-

141	Uncertain significance	Dec 18, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with tryptophan at codon 132 of the SLC52A3 protein (p.Arg132Trp). The arginine residue is weakly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and tryptophan. This variant is present in population databases (rs267606684, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been reported to segregate with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) in a single family (PMID: 2020633). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 141). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change leads to cellular mislocalization of the SLC52A3 protein (PMID: 22273710). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

144	Uncertain significance	Apr 04, 2018	Variant classified as Uncertain Significance - Favor Pathogenic. The p.Val413Ala variant in SLC53A3 has been reported in the compound heterozygous state in 3 pr obands with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS; Green 2010, Ciccolella 201 2, Davis 2016). It has also been identified in 3/64554 European chromosomes by t he Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs267606687). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is not high enough to rule out a pathogenic role. Computational predi ction tools and conservation analysis suggest that the variant may not impact th e protein, though this information is not predictive enough to rule out pathogen icity. In summary, while there is some suspicion for a pathogenic role, the clin ical significance of the p.Val413Ala variant is uncertain.

144	Uncertain significance	Dec 11, 2019	This sequence change replaces valine with alanine at codon 413 of the SLC52A3 protein (p.Val413Ala). The valine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between valine and alanine. This variant is present in population databases (rs267606687, ExAC 0.007%). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere Syndrome (BVVLS) (PMID: 20206331, 22824638, 26443808, 27777325). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 144). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

157	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The OAT c.1250C>T (p.Pro417Leu) missense variant has been reported in three studies in which it is found in at least four individuals with ornithine aminotransferase deficiency including in three individuals in a compound heterozygous state, one of whom carried a third suspected benign variant in cis, as well as in one individual who was homozygous for the variant and carried the same presumed benign variant in cis (Brody et al. 1992; Sergouniotis et al. 2012; Doimo et al. 2013). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00023 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project but this is based on two alleles so the variant is presumed to be rare. The variant was expressed independently in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and yielded low levels of OAT antigen and absence of OAT activity (Brody et al. 1992). The p.Pro417Leu variant was also expressed in yeast and was found to have less than ten percent of OAT activity compared to wild type and failed to act as a functional complement to allow growth of a yeast strain containing a deletion variant of the CargB gene (Doimo et al. 2013). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Pro417Leu variant is classified as pathogenic for ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

168	Likely pathogenic	Dec 26, 2016	This sequence change replaces proline with leucine at codon 241 of the OAT protein (p.Pro241Leu). The proline residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and leucine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121965051, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been observed in two individuals affected with gyrate atrophy (PMID: 1737786, Invitae). Analysis of fibroblasts from an affected individual who harbored this mutation showed that this variant does not affect mRNA expression but results in the loss of OAT protein expression (PMID: 1737786). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 168). Gene-specific computational analysis indicated that this variant causes loss of structural stability in OAT protein (http://www.rjpbcs.com/pdf/2014_5(5)/[199].pdf). In summary, this variant is a rare missense change that has been identified in affected individuals and shown to affect protein function. This evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional genetic or functional data are needed to prove that conclusively.

178	Uncertain significance	Nov 22, 2018	The OAT c.192_193delAG (p.Gly65LysfsTer15) variant results in a frameshift, and is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Gly65LysfsTer15 variant has been identified in one patient with ornithine aminotransferase deficiency in a compound heterozygous state with a missense variant (Mashima et al. 1992). OAT enzyme activity was demonstrated to be undetectable in patient fibroblasts (Mashima et al. 1992). Control data are unavailable for this variant which is reported at a frequency of 0.000039 in the European (non-Finnish) population from the Genome Aggregation Database. The evidence for this variant is limited. The p.Gly65LysfsTer15 variant is therefore classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

197	Pathogenic	Jan 22, 2016	Variant summary: The c.218G>T in TMEM216 gene is a missense variant that involves a non-conserved nucleotide and 5/5 in silico tools predict deleterious outcome. The variant is present in the broad control population dataset of ExAC at a low frequency, exclusively in European cohort (0.024%), which does not exceed the maximum frequency for a pathogenic variant in TMEM216 gene (0.39%), suggesting this variant is not a common polymorphism. The variant has been reported in multiple affected individuals presented with JBTS2. This variant is considered to be a founder mutation in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The carrier frequency in the Ashkenazi population was reported to be about 1:100 (Valente et al., 2010). The variant of interest has been reported as Pathogenic by several reputable databases. Taking together, the variant was classified as Pathogenic.

197	Pathogenic	Dec 07, 2018	The R73L pathogenic variant in the TMEM216 gene has been reported previously as a homozygous variant in individuals with Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) and appears to be a founder mutation among the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Edvardson et al., 2010; reported as R12L using alternate nomenclature). Additional studies have reported a significant decrease in TMEM216 protein production in cells transfected with R73L compared to the wild type and ciliogenesis disruption in TMEM216-R73L mutated fibroblasts in affected individuals (Lee et al., 2012; Valente et al., 2010). This variant was not observed in approximately 6,100 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R73L variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Additionally, other missense variants at the same amino acid position (R73C; R73H) have also been reported in association with Joubert syndrome and related disorders (Valente et al., 2010).

197	Pathogenic	Jan 02, 2020	This sequence change replaces arginine with leucine at codon 73 of the TMEM216 protein (p.Arg73Leu). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and leucine. This variant is present in population databases (rs201108965, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported as homozygous and in combination with another TMEM216 variant in many individuals affected with Joubert syndrome and is a known founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (PMID: 20036350, 20512146, 26092869, 26673778). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 197). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change leads to an unstable TMEM216 protein which disrupts normal ciliogenesis (PMID: 20512146, 22282472). Other missense substitutions at this codon (p.Arg73His and p.Arg73Cys) have been reported in individuals affected with Joubert syndrome (PMID: 20512146). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

197	Pathogenic	Dec 14, 2018	The TMEM216 c.218G>T (p.Arg73Leu) missense variant is noted to be a founder variant in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Parisi et al. 2013). Across a selection of available literature, the p.Arg73Leu variant has been identified in a total of 40 individuals with Joubert syndrome including 39 homozygotes and one compound heterozygote. The variant was also identified in a heterozygous state in 119 unaffected family members (Edvardson et al. 2010; Valente et al. 2010; Bachmann-Gagescu et al. 2015). Additionally the p.Arg73Leu variant was found in a homozygous state in a Turkish family in which Meckel syndrome and Joubert syndrome coexisted within the same sibship (Valente et al. 2010). The p.Arg73Leu variant was reported in 30 of 2766 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish individuals in a heterozygous state and is reported at a frequency of 0.003381 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Lee et al. (2012) reported that fibroblasts from a patient carrying the p.Arg73Leu variant showed failure of ciliogenesis. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg73Leu variant is classified as pathogenic for TMEM216-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

198	Pathogenic	May 30, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with histidine at codon 73 of the TMEM216 protein (p.Arg73His). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and histidine. This variant is present in population databases (rs201108965, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous in a family affected with Joubert syndrome-related disorders (PMID: 20512146). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 198). This variant has been reported to affect TMEM216 protein function (PMID: 20512146). This variant disrupts the p.Arg73 amino acid residue in TMEM216. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 20036350, 20512146, 26092869, 26673778). This suggests that this residue is clinically significant, and that variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be disease-causing. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

208	Pathogenic	Sep 11, 2017	The D276N variant in the PEPD gene has been reported previously in association with autosomal recessive prolidase deficiency when present in the homozygous state (Tanoue et al., 1990). One functional study concluded this variant results in severely impaired enzyme activity (Tanoue et al., 1990). The D276N variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The D276N variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. We interpret D276N as a pathogenic variant.

213	Pathogenic	Dec 11, 2018	The PEPD c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Arg) missense variant has been reported in four studies in which it is found in a total of eight individuals with prolidase deficiency (PD). The variant was found in five individuals in a homozygous state, including a sibling pair, and in three compound heterozygotes, two of whom were related (Ledoux et al. 1994; Forlino et al. 2002; Lupi et al. 2006; Vestita et al. 2017). Ledoux et al. (1994), Lupi et al. (2006) and Besio et al. (2013) demonstrated that prolidase activity in fibroblasts from patients with PD with the p.Gly448Arg variant was reduced to <2% to 13.1% when compared to controls. In addition, transient expression of the p.Gly448Arg variant in COS1 cells produced an inactive enzyme (Ledoux et al. 1996), and a recombinant PEPD enzyme containing the p.Gly448Arg variant showed very low catalytic efficiency, thermal instability, and changes in protein conformations (Besio et al. 2013). Forlino et al. (2002) also showed that cultured PD patient fibroblasts with the p.Gly448Arg variant exhibited multiple cell structure abnormalities. This variant was absent in 150 control chromosomes and is reported at a frequency of 0.000036 in the European (non-Finnish) population. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Gly448Arg variant is classified as pathogenic for prolidase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

213	Pathogenic	Feb 25, 2016	The p.Gly448Arg variant in PEPD has been reported in 6 individuals with prolidas e deficiency. Three of these individuals were homozygous and three compound hete rozygous with another pathogenic variant in PEPD (Ledoux 1994, Lupi 2006, Forlin o 2002). This variant has also been identified in 0.027% (2/7412) of European ch romosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute. org; dbSNP rs121917724). Although this variant is seen in the general population , its frequency is consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In addition, i n vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Gly448Arg variant ma y impact protein function (Ledoux 1996, Besio 2013). In summary, this variant me ets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for prolidase deficiency in an a utosomal recessive manner based upon its co-occurrence in trans with other patho genic variants in patients, low frequency in controls and functional evidence.

219	Pathogenic	Mar 14, 2019	This sequence change replaces cysteine with serine at codon 163 of the AGA protein (p.Cys163Ser). The cysteine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between cysteine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121964904, ExAC 0.8%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous and in combination with another AGA variant in numerous individuals and families affected with aspartylglucosaminuria (PMID: 1904874, 2011603, 1703489, 21228398, 11309371, 7627186). This variant is known in the literature as AGAFin, and is a common pathogenic variant in individuals of Finnish ancestry. Of note, this variant frequently co-occurs in cis with the functionally Benign AGA p.Arg161Gln variant (PMID: 27876883). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 219). This variant has been reported to affect AGA protein function (PMID: 1904874, 1765378, 8172656). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

223	Likely pathogenic	Apr 15, 2016	The c.302C>T (p.Ala101Val) missense variant in the AGA gene has been previously reported in two individuals affected with Aspartylglucosaminuria (Ikonen et al., 1991). In one of the affected individuals, this variant was observed in trans with a pathogenic variant (c.102_108del, p.Trp34*) (Ikonen et al., 1991). This variant is located at the dimer interface of the protein and is thus predicted to affect protein interaction and dimerization; additional, in vitro functional studies have shown the enzymatic activity was undetectable when this variant was introduced (Saito et al., 2008). This variant is reported at low frequency in the population databases (Exome Sequencing Project = 0%; 1000 Genomes = NA; and ExAC = 0.006%). Multiple in silico algorithms predict this variant to have a deleterious effect (GERP = 5.93; CADD = 36; PolyPhen = 1.0; SIFT = 0.0). AGA is the only gene in which pathogenic variants are known to cause Aspartylglucosaminuria. Therefore, this collective evidence supports the classification of the c.302C>T (p.Ala101Val) as a Likely pathogenic variant for Aspartylglucosaminuria. We have confirmed this finding in our laboratory using Sanger sequencing.

225	Pathogenic	Apr 11, 2018	Variant summary: AGA c.800dupT (p.Pro268AlafsX52) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. The variant was observed with an allele freqyency of 2.8e-05 in 246258 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in AGA causing Aspartylglucosaminuria (2.8e-05 vs 0.0049), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.800dupT, has been reported in the literature in a homozygous individual affected with Aspartylglucosaminuria, who presented with less than 10% normal AGA activity (Ikonen_1991). These data indicate that the variant may be associated with disease. A ClinVar submission from a clinical diagnostic laboratory (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as "likely pathogenic." Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

248	Pathogenic	May 26, 2017	The R160X variant in the CYB5R3 gene has been reported previously in association with autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia type II (Aalfs et al., 2000). The R160X mutation with a second nonsense mutation, Q77X , was reported in an eight-year-old deceased patient who suffered from methemoglobinemia type II, who initally presented with cyanosis, severe failure to thrive, neurologic symptoms and microcephaly (Aalfs et al., 2000). The R160X mutation is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The R160X mutation was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. We interpret R160X as a pathogenic variant. This variant has been seen to be paternally inherited.

253	Uncertain significance	Jan 06, 2020	NM_004628.4:c.1001C>A (p.Pro334His) was previously reported as P218H. This variant has an allele frequency of 0.026 in African subpopulation in the gnomAD database. It has been reported previously in individuals with Xeroderma Pigmentosum in homozygous state (PMID: 17079196, 17084680). Functional studies show p.Pro334His mutation prevents the stimulation of Ogg1 glycosylase because it thwarts the interaction between XPC and Ogg1 (PMID: 18809580). Benign computational verdict because benign predictions from DEOGEN2, EIGEN, FATHMM-MKL, MVP, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, PrimateAI, REVEL and SIFT vs 1 pathogenic prediction from DANN and the position is not conserved.

This variant is present in population databases (rs752088918, ExAC 0.008%). This variant has been observed to segregate with xeroderma pigmentosum in a family (PMID: 11121128). This variant is also known as c.669_670delAT in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 258). Loss-of-function variants in XPC are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 23173980, 25256075). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

258	Uncertain significance	Oct 10, 2018	The XPC c.566_567delAT (p.Tyr189SerfsTer10) variant results in a frameshift and is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. It was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population. It had not been previously curated by ICSL or reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD: prior to June 1st, 2018) and was therefore a candidate for classification through an automated scoring system. Utilizing variant allele frequency, disease prevalence and penetrance estimates, and inheritance mode, an automated score was calculated to assess if this variant is too frequent to cause the disease. Based on the score for this variant, it could not be ruled out of causing disease and therefore its association with disease required further investigation. A literature search was performed for the gene and cDNA change, and amino acid change. No publications were found based on this search. Due to the potential impact of frameshift variants and the lack of clarifying evidence, this variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for xeroderma pigmentosum.

258	Pathogenic	Jul 20, 2017	Variant summary: The c.566_567delAT (p.Tyr189Serfs) variant in XPC gene is a frameshift change predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. These predictions were confirmed by Northern blot analysis that has revealed greatly reduced xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C mRNA as well as reductions in post-ultraviolet survival rate, unscheduled DNA synthesis, global genome DNA repair deficiency and aborted plasmid host cell reactivation (Slor ,2000). The variant is present in the large control population dataset of ExAC at a low frequency 0.00004 (5/113986 chrs tested), exclusively in individuals of European descent (0.000079; 5/63374 chrs tested) which does not exceed the maximal expected frequency of a pathogenic allele (0.0014) in this gene. The variant of interest has been reported homozygously in at least 3 XP-C patients. The c.566_567delAT is cited as Pathogenic by reputable database/diagnostic center. Taken together, the variant was classified as Pathogenic.

262	Pathogenic	Oct 19, 2017	Variant summary: The XPC c.1643_1644delTG (p.Val548AlafsX25) variant results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncated or absent XPC protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. One in silico tool predicts a damaging outcome for this variant. Functional studies showed absence of XPC protein expression in lymphoblasts from XP patients and reduced post-UV unscheduled DNA synthesis (Khan_2006). This variant was found in 5/246258 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0000203, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic XPC variant (0.0014142). This variant is considered a founder mutation and is reported in 87% of XP-C cases from North Africa (Bensenouci_2016, El-Harith_2012, Khan_2006). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

268	Pathogenic	Dec 16, 2014	The p.Pro638Leu variant in RBM20 has been reported in 3 families with DCM, segre gated with disease in >10 affected individuals (including 2 affected obligate ca rriers) and was absent from 2160 control chromosomes (Brauch 2009, Refaat 2012) and other large population studies. Additionally, this variant has been identifi ed by our laboratory in 2 individuals with DCM and LV dilation/dysfunction, 1 in dividual with atypical ARVC, and segregated with disease in 2 affected relatives . In vitro studies suggest that the p.Pro638Leu variant may impact protein funct ion (Guo 2012). Proline (Pro) at position 638 is highly conserved in mammals and evolutionarily distant species and lies within a conserved protein domain in wh ich other pathogenic variants have been reported (Brauch 2009, Li 2010). In summ ary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for DCM in a n autosomal dominant manner (http://www.partners.org/personalizedmedicine/LMM) based upon segregation studies, absence from controls, and functional evidence.

268	Pathogenic	Nov 17, 2016	The Pro638Leu mutation in the RBM20 gene has been reported previously in association with DCM (Brauch K et al., 2009). Brauch et al. identified the Pro638Leu through linkage analysis of a large family with three generations of individuals with DCM. The same study subsequently identified this mutation in a second family with multiple affected individuals and this mutation was absent from 960 control alleles. In addition, Pro638Leu was not observed in approximately 2,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Pro638Leu is located in exon 9 of RBM20, described as a mutation hot spot, and where mutations in nearby residues (Arg636Cys, Arg636His, Arg636Ser, Ser637Gly) have been reported in association with DCM (Brauch K et al., 2009). In summary, Pro638Leu in the RBM20 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.

268	Pathogenic	May 29, 2018	This sequence change replaces proline with leucine at codon 638 of the RBM20 protein (p.Pro638Leu). The proline residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and leucine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in the literature to segregate with disease in two families with multiple members affected with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (PMID: 19712804), as well as in one unrelated individual with DCM (PMID: 22004663). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 268). One experimental study has shown that this missense change disturbs RBM20 protein activity (PMID: 22466703). This variant lies within the RS domain of RBM20 that has been shown to be critical for the nuclear localization of the protein (PMID: 23886709). The majority of previously described disease causing variants in RBM20 are located in a stretch of 5 amino acids (p.Arg634-p.Pro638) within this domain (PMID: 19712804).

269	Pathogenic	Apr 06, 2017	p.Arg634Gln (c.1901G>A) (R634Q) in exon 9 of the RBM20 gene (NM_001134363.1) Given the case data, strong segregation data, supporting in-vitro data, location of the variant in the â€œhotspotâ€ region of exon 9, and low prevalence in controls, we consider this variant very likely disease causing and we do feel it is suitable for assessing risk in healthy relatives ("predictive genetic testing"). I checked with LMM, and they have not seen the variant but would classify it as either likely pathogenic or pathogenic (Colleen, 2015). RBM20: Variants in RBM20 are relatively newly-reported with cardiomyopathy and appear to be an infrequent cause of cardiomyopathy (1.9-3.0%) so only minimal data on disease-associated variation in this gene is available. Brauch et al (2009) performed genome-wide linkage analysis in two multi-generational kindreds with DCM, with a LOD score of 3.55. Interestingly, at the time of this study the function of RBM20 was not known, though it was known to be expressed at much higher levels in the heart than in other tissues. Sequencing of the candidate region identified two RBM20 variants, one in each family, that segregated with disease and were absent in 480 controls. They then performed DHLPC analysis of RBM20 in a cohort of 279 DCM patients and identified 6 additional families with RBM20 variants. Hershberger's group used a candidate gene approach, sequencing select RBM20 exons in 312 DCM probands and found rare variants in 6 unrelated patients. RBM20 has been implicated in abnormal TTN splicing and RBM20 deficient mice show signs of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias (Guo et al 2013). Based on the domains identified in RBM20 it is thought to be an RNA binding protein. Of note, an area in exon 9 appears to be especially susceptible to pathogenic variation. Both variants from the original linkage study were in exon 9. Per an LMM review of the data: "Further study in a larger cohort identified additional variants that all clustered in exon 9, specifically the RS domain. All of these variants segregated with disease and were not identified in controls. This association was further examined by Li and colleagues in 2010, identifying both novel and previously reported variants (Brauch 2009) in the same region of exon 9 in a different cohort of individuals with DCM. More recent studies provide further support for this association (Guo 2012, Refaat 2012). While further study is needed, variants in this particular region of RBM20 appear to be associated with an earlier age of onset, high penetrance, end-stage heart failure and a high mortality." Furthermore, LMM's own internal experience is consistent with the published data: "after 3 years of testing, our laboratory has identified 3 clinically significant variants (classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic) in this hotspot region of exon 9 in 6 families with DCM; 2 of these families had been previously tested by our laboratory and were negative for any disease-causing variants. All 3 of these variants had been previously reported (Brauch 2009, Li 2010), further supporting that the RS region of exon 9 is likely a hotspot of variation. In addition, the phenotype in these families is consistent with those described previously, which emphasizes the importance and significance of identifying families with disease-causing variation in RBM20 so that the proper management and screening can be implemented." Hershberger's group suggests this is a 5 amino acid hot spot. This region is rich in arginines and serines and is predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Brauch et al (2009) noted a particularly malignant course in families with RBM20 variants, compared to other familial DCM cases. Age of diagnosis of DCM was 9 years younger and many affected individuals died suddenly, needed transplant, or an ICD. Some individuals had left ventricular hypertrophy. While many pedigrees had quite severe disease there was still variability among family members, as	not provided	CN517202:not provided	no assertion criteria provided	provider interpretation	germline:na	Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, Stanford University	SCV000924915.1	RBM20	-
269	Pathogenic	Dec 19, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with glutamine at codon 634 of the RBM20 protein (p.Arg634Gln). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant is not present in population databases (rs267607001, ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to segregate with dilated cardiomyopathy in a single large family (PMID: 19712804) and has been observed in patients with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy (PMID: 20590677, 22004663). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 269). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change is functionally inactive in a RBM20-dependent TTN splicing assay (PMID: 22466703). This variant lies within a previously described mutation rich region between residues 634 and 638. The majority of previously described disease causing variants in RBM20 are located in this region (PMID: 19712804, 2204663). In summary, this variant is absent from controls, has been shown to segregate with dilated cardiomyopathy, has a deleterious effect on RBM20 activity, and is located in a well characterized mutation rich region. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

269	Pathogenic	May 18, 2018	The R634Q pathogenic variant in the RBM20 gene has previously been reported in one large Norwegian family with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (Brauch et al., 2009). Brauch et al. (2009) observed this variant segregating with DCM in nine affected relatives, and it was not observed in any unaffected relatives. This variant has also been reported in a sporadic case of DCM and in a child with sudden cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death, however, it is uncertain if these individuals may have harbored variants in other genes (Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015). The R634Q variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The R634Q variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. The R634Q variant is located in the exon 9 hot-spot" region of the RBM20 gene, where many pathogenic variants are located (Brauch et al., 2009). Furthermore, Guo et al. (2012) performed an in vitro splice reporter assay for R634Q which supported an adverse effect to this region when compared to wild-type. We interpret R634Q as a pathogenic variant."

270	Likely pathogenic	Oct 31, 2016	The p.Arg636Ser variant in RBM20 has been reported in 3 individuals with DCM, se gregated with disease in 6 affected relatives from 2 families, and was absent fr om 960 race-matched control chromosomes (Brauch 2009). In addition, this variant has been identified by our laboratory in 1 individual with DCM and 1 individual with LVNC. In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Arg636S er variant may impact protein function (Guo 2012, Wyles 2016). However, these ty pes of assays may not accurately represent biological function. Computational pr ediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that this variant may impact th e protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathoge nicity. In addition, this variant lies within exon 9, which encodes a conserved protein domain where other pathogenic variants have been reported (Brauch 2009, Li 2010). Lastly, a different disease-causing substitution has been reported at this position (p.Arg636His; Brauch 2009, Li 2010, Wells 2013, LMM data) suggesti ng that changes at this position may not be tolerated. In summary, although addi tional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, the p. Arg636Ser variant is likely pathogenic.

270	Pathogenic	Dec 08, 2017	The R636S pathogenic variant in the RBM20 gene has been reported previously in three families with DCM and wasnot identified in 480 control subjects with normal echocardiograms (Brauch et al, 2009). Wyles et al. (2016) observedthat R636S segregated with DCM in at least five family members and conducted in vitro functional studies usingreprogrammed human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiated to beating cardiomyocytes (CMs) bearingthe R636S variant. RBM20 DCM hiPSC-CMs harboring R636S were less capable of maintaining their sarcomericstructure, demonstrated defective Ca2+ handling, and were more susceptible to positive chronotropic (heart rate) stress(Wyles et al., 2016). Additionally, R636S was not observed in approximately 2,300 individuals of European andAfrican American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant inthese populations. Pathogenic variants at this residue (R636H, R636C) and nearby residues (R634Q, R634W,P638L) have been reported in HGMD in association with DCM, further supporting the functional importance of thisresidue and this region of the protein (Stenson et al., 2014).In summary, R636S in the RBM20 gene is interpreted as a pathogenic variant.

270	Pathogenic	Mar 28, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with serine at codon 636 of the RBM20 protein (p.Arg636Ser). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and serine. This variant is not present in population databases (rs267607002, ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to segregate with dilated cardiomyopathy in several families (PMID: 19712804). It has been observed in multiple unrelated individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy as well (PMID: 19712804, 26604136, Invitae). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 270). Two additional missense substitutions (p.Arg636Cys and p.Arg636His) are reported to be deleterious (PMID: 19712804, 20590677, 21483645, 23861363, 24503780, 26084686). The p.Arg636 residue is located in a stretch of 5 amino acids (p.Arg634-p.Pro638) that is important for nuclear localization of the protein and the majority of the known disease causing variants in RBM20 are located in this region (PMID: 19712804, 23886709). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change is functionally inactive in a RBM20-dependent TTN splicing assay (PMID: 22466703).

271	Pathogenic	Nov 30, 2018	The R636H pathogenic variant in the RBM20 gene has been reported in several unrelated families with DCM (Brauch et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Wells et al., 2013; Akinrinade et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 2017). Brauch et al. (2009) initially identified R636H in two siblings diagnosed with DCM in their 40s and a family history of sudden death. Subsequently, Li et al. (2010) reported R636H in three individuals from one family with DCM. Wells et al. (2013) reported R636H co-segregated with disease in 15 members of one family. Although the R363H variant results in a conservative amino acid substitution, in-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. Collectively R636H was not observed in more than 930 control samples (Brauch et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010), and it is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016).

271	Pathogenic	Nov 19, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with histidine at codon 636 of the RBM20 protein (p.Arg636His). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and histidine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in many individuals affected with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (PMID: 23861363, 24503780, 26084686) and has been shown to segregate with DCM in affected families (PMID: 19712804, 20590677). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 271). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg636Cys) has been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 20590677, 21483645). This suggests that the arginine residue is critical for RBM20 protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. This variant lies within the RS domain of RBM20 that has been shown to be critical for nuclear localization of the protein (PMID: 23886709). The majority of previously described disease causing variants in RBM20 are located in a stretch of 5 amino acids (p.Arg634-p.Pro638) in this domain (PMID: 19712804).

284	Pathogenic	Oct 22, 2018	The VWD c.4883T>C (p.Ile1628Thr) missense variant has been reported in at least four studies in which it is found in at least 28 individuals with different subtypes of von Willebrand disease (VWD) (Iannuzzi et al. 1991; Melo-Nava et al. 2007; Woods et al. 2011, Ahmad et al. 2014). In one study the p.Ile1628Thr variant was found in a heterozygous state in 18 individuals affected with type 2A VWD and was shown to segregate with disease across three generations, where the authors note that all affected family members were heterozygous for the variant, while none of the unaffected members carried the variant, however only exon 28 of the VWF gene was sequenced in this study (Iannuzzi et al. 1991). In a second study, the variant was found in a heterozygous state in five individuals, all with type 2A VWD, one with mild bleeding severity, three with moderate bleeding severity and one with severe bleeding severity (Melo-Nava et al. 2007). Woods et al. (2011) reported one individual, who was heterozygous for p.Ile1628Thr variant and affected with both type 1 and type 2M VWD, who carried an additional heterozygous missense variant inherited from his mother who was affected with type VWD. The father and sister were affected with type 2M VWD and heterozygous for the p.Ile1628Thr variant. Two further individuals with type 2A VWD and heterozygous for the p.Ile1628Thr variant were also reported. Both mothers and one sister also carried the variant, but their affected status was not clear (Ahmed et al. 2014). The p.Ile1628Thr variant was absent from 334 control alleles and is not found in the 1000 Genomes Project, the Exome Sequencing Project, the Exome Aggregation Consortium, or the Genome Aggregation Database, in a region with good sequence coverage and hence is presumed to be rare. Functional studies demonstrated that the recombinant variant protein had little or no effect on the ADAMTS13-dependent proteolysis of VWF when compared to wild type (Hassenpflug et al. 2006; Zanardelli et al. 2006). Structural studies showed that the variant destabilized the native folded state of the protein and lowered the in silico tensile force which is important in the first event of the unfolding pathway (Interlandi et al. 2012). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ile1628Thr variant is classified as pathogenic for von Willebrand disease. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

284	Pathogenic	Jan 21, 2019	The missense variant VWF c.4883T>C, p.Ile1628Thr (p.I1628T) in exon 28 changes amino acid isoleucine at codon 1628 to threonine. The isoleucine at this residue is highly conserved among species. This amino acid change occurs in the A2 domain, a functional domain that is cleaved by ADAMTS13 (Springer, 2014). This sequence variant has been previously reported in patients with type 2A von Willebrand disease (Iannuzzi, 1991; Hassenpflug, 2006; Ahmed, 2013) and has been observed in multiple patients with type 2A VWD in our laboratory cohort. Functional studies of the variant in mammalian cells demonstrated loss of high molecular weight multimers (Hassenpflug, 2006) due to hypersensitivity to ADAMTS13 induced increased proteolysis in plasma (Michiels, 2017). To date, this variant has not been reported in the general population (GnomAD, Exome Variant Server). In summary, the collective evidence supports VWF c.4883T>C, p.Ile1628Thr as a pathogenic variant in regards to type 2A von Willebrand disease.

In vitro studies have shown that this variant results in increased susceptibility to ADAMTS13 cleavage (Hassenpflug 2006, Pruss 2012, Pruss 2008). It has also been shown that plasma samples from patients carrying this variant lack high molecular weight multimers of Von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Hassenpflug 2006, Starke 2013). This variant is reported as pathogenic in ClinVar (Variation ID: 285) and is absent from the general population databases (1000 Genomes Project, Exome Variant Server, Genome Aggregation Database), indicating it is not a common polymorphism. Additionally, several other variants at codon 1597 have been reported in patients with type 2A VWD (Donner 1993, Ginsburg 1993, Melo-Nava 2007, Veyradier 2016). The arginine at codon 1597 is highly conserved in the calcium-binding loop of VWF A2 domain (Xu 2013) and computational algorithms (PolyPhen-2, SIFT) predict this variant is deleterious. Based on the above information, this variant is classified as pathogenic. References: Baronciani L et al. von Willebrand factor collagen binding assay in von Willebrand disease type 2A, 2B, and 2M.

288	Pathogenic	Sep 20, 2017	The VWF c.3916C>T, p.Arg1306Trp variant (also known as Arg534Trp) is reported in the medical literature in multiple families affected by von Willebrand disease type IIB (Cooney 1991, Lillicrap 1991, Pietu 1991, Randi 1991, Donner 1992, Casana 1998, Ozeki 2010) and co-segregates with affected family members (Lillicrap 1991, Donner 1992, Casana 1998). Functional characterization of the p.Arg1306Trp protein indicates a greater sensitivity to shear stress, leading to a reduction of high molecular weight multimers in plasma (Scaglione 2013). The variant is listed in the ClinVar database (Variation ID:288) and the dbSNP variant database (rs61749384), but not observed in the general population databases (1000 Genomes Project, Exome Variant Server, Genome Aggregation Database). The arginine at residue 1306 is moderately conserved, and computational algorithms (Align GV/GD, Mutation Taster, PolyPhen-2, SIFT) predict that the variant has an impact on protein structure or function. Based on the above information, the variant is classified as pathogenic. References: Casana P et al.

288	Pathogenic	May 14, 2018	The missense variant VWF c.3916C>T, p.Arg1306Trp (p.R1306W) in exon 28 changes amino acid arginine at codon 1306 to tryptophan. The arginine at this residue is somewhat conserved among species. This amino acid change occurs in the A1 domain, a functional domain that binds GP1ba and collagen (Springer, 2014). This sequence variant has been previously reported in patients with type 2B von Willebrand disease (Cooney, 1991; Randi, 1991; Ozeki, 2010) and has been observed in multiple patients with type 2B VWD in our laboratory cohort. Functional studies of the variant in mammalian cells demonstrated significantly increased platelet binding in the presence and absence of ristocetin (Cooney, 1996) and dramatic enhancement of multimer sensitivity to shear stress. (Scaglione, 2013). To date, this variant has not been reported in the general population (GnomAD, Exome Variant Server). In summary, the collective evidence supports VWF c.3916C>T, p.Arg1306Trp as a pathogenic variant for type 2B von Willebrand disease.

289	Pathogenic	Jul 09, 2019	The missense variant VWF c.3922C>T, p.Arg1308Cys (p.R1308C; legacy p.R545C) in exon 28 changes amino acid arginine at codon 1308 to cysteine. The arginine at this residue is not well conserved among species. This amino acid change occurs in the A1 domain, a functional domain that binds GPIb (Springer, 2014). Pathogenic variants in VWF are associated with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive von Willebrand disease (VWD), characterized by quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor and resulting in prolonged bleeding. This sequence variant has been previously reported in patients with type 2B von Willebrand disease (Randi, 1991; Ranger, 2012; Ahmad,2013; Frietas, 2019) and has been observed in multiple patients with type 2B von Willebrand disease in our laboratory cohort. Functional studies of the variant in mammalian cells show an increased affinity for GPIb or enhanced responsiveness with ristoceitin and preferential cleavage of high molecular weight multimers under fluid stress and natured conditions (Ahmad, 2013; Ma, 2015). To date, this variant has not been reported in the general population (gnomAD, Exome Variant Server). In summary, the collective evidence supports VWF c.3922C>T, p.Arg1308Cys as a dominant pathogenic variant for von Willebrand disease type 2B.

290	Pathogenic	May 09, 2019	The VWF c.3946G>A; p.Val1316Met variant (rs61749397), also known in traditional nomenclature as p.Val553Met, is described in the literature in individuals and families with von Willebrand disease type 2B (Casana 1998, Federici 2009, Goodeve 2010, Jackson 2009, Randi 1991). This variant been described in at least one family to segregate with disease with autosomal dominant inheritance (Jackson 2009) and has also been found to occur de novo (Randi 1990). This variant is absent from general population databases (Exome Variant Server, Genome Aggregation Database), indicating it is not a common polymorphism, and it is reported as pathogenic by several laboratories in ClinVar (Variation ID: 290). The valine at codon 1316 is highly conserved, and computational analyses (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) predict that this variant is deleterious. Further, a mouse model expressing the p.Val1316Met variant exhibits similar physiological symptoms as human patients with this variant, including increased bleeding, reduced platelet aggregation, and macrothrombocytopenia (Adam 2016,Kauskot 2016). Based on available information, the p.Val1316Met variant is considered to be pathogenic. References: Adam F et al.

290	Pathogenic	Sep 20, 2019	The missense variant VWF c.3946G>A, p.Val1316Met (p.V1316M; mature protein p.V553M) in exon 28 changes amino acid valine at codon 1316 to methionine. The valine at this residue is highly conserved among species. This amino acid change occurs in the A1 domain, a functional domain that binds GPIba (Springer, 2014). Pathogenic variants in VWF are associated with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive von Willebrand disease (VWD), characterized by quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor and resulting in prolonged bleeding. This sequence variant has been previously reported in patients with type 2B VWD. Patients with this variant have a unique phenotype of severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding, giant platelets, and spontaneous platelet aggregation in vitro (Jackson, 2009; Poon, 2010; Espitia, 2017; Rotz, 2017). To date, this variant has not been reported in the general population (GnomAD, Exome Variant Server, ExAC, Variation Viewer). Functional studies of the p.V1316M variant in COS-7 cells mimic the patient laboratory phenotype: binding is significantly increased in the absence of agonist, in the presence of ristocetin, or in the presence of low concentrations of botrocetin, and platelet aggregation is increased by SIPA (Ajzenberg, 2000). In summary, the collective evidence supports VWF c.3946G>A, p.Val1316Met as a pathogenic variant for type 2B VWD.

This variant has been identified in 0.45% (298/66730) of European chromoso mes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; d bSNP rs41276738). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency . Functional studies indicate the p.Arg854Gln variant may affect protein functio n (Wang 2012, Skipwith 2013). In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for type 2N von Willebrand disease in an autosomal rece ssive manner.

Pathogenic missense variants in the D'D3 domain have been shown to cause autosomal recessive type 2N VWD, characterized by low plasma factor VIII levels and a laboratory phenotype that can initially resemble hemophilia A. This sequence variant has is one of the most common reported variants in patients with type 2N VWD (Hilbert, 2004; Goodeve, 2007; Veyradier, 2011; van Meegeren, 2015; Borras, 2017). Functional studies of p.R854Q mutant in mamalian cells showed decreased FVIII binding (Hilbert, 2004; Swystun, 2017). The minor allele frequency of this variant in the general population is 0.003465 (gnomAD). In summary, the collective evidence supports VWF c.2561G>A, p.Arg854Gln as a pathogenic variant for type 2N von Willebrand disease.

296	Pathogenic	Jun 14, 2016	The c.2561G>A (p.Arg854Gln) variant is found specifically in patients with type 2N von Willebrand disease (VWD) which manifests as a mild form of VWD with only moderate bleeding in homozygotes. This variant is well-documented as disease-causing for this specific type of VWD, found in up to 73% of type 2N patients to date (Casonato et al. 2013). The variant is also common among Caucasians, being found in over 1% of the general population (Goodeve et al. 2010). Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Arg854Gln variant has been reported in seven studies and found in a total of 72 patients including in 26 in a homozygous state, 12 in a compound heterozygous state and 34 in a heterozygous state in whom a second variant as not been found (Gaucher et al. 1991; Cacheris et al. 1991; Peerlinck et al. 1992; Hilbert et al. 2004; Hilbert et al. 2006; Veyradier et al. 2011; Casonato et al. 2013). The variant was absent from 906 control alleles and is reported at a frequency of 0.014 in the Puerto Rican population of the 1000 Genomes Project. Functional studies have demonstrated that the p.Arg854Gln variant results in reduced binding of FVIII and proteolysis by ADAMTS13 with a normal multimer pattern (Gaucher et al. 1991; Cacheris et al. 1991; Peerlinck et al. 1992; Hilbert et al. 2004; Hilbert et al. 2006; Skipwith et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg854Gln variant is classified as pathogenic for von Willebrand disease.	von Willebrand Disease	C0042974:von Willebrand disorder	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory,Illumina	SCV000380622.2	VWF	-

296	Pathogenic	Feb 08, 2018	The R854Q variant in the VWF gene is the most frequent cause of von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 2N (Castaman et al., 2010) and has been reported previously in the homozygous state or in trans with another pathogenic variant in multiple unrelated individuals with autosomal recessive VWD type 2N (Gaucher et al., 1991; Castaman et al., 2010; Hilbert et al., 2004). One individual has been reported to have an autosomal recessive form of VWD type 1 due to a maternally inherited R854Q variant in trans with a hypomorphic allele, inherited from a father with low VWF antigen and a slightly increased bleeding time (Peerlinck et al., 1992). Functional studies of the R854Q variant, referred to as R91Q due to alternate nomenclature, demonstrate a dramatically diminished capacity of VWF to bind factor VIII (Cacheris et al., 1991; Hilbert et al., 2003). An asymptomatic individual heterozygous for the R854Q variant had normal plasma levels of VWF but a reduced binding ability to factor VIII, while cultured blood outgrowth endothelial cells with the R854Q variant stored VWF properly but produced less VWF than normal cells (Wang et al., 2013). The NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project reports R854Q was present in 48/8600 alleles (0.56%) from individuals of European ancestry, but was not present in the homozygous state in any individual within this population. The R854Q variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. We interpret R854Q as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000322001.6	VWF	-

299	Pathogenic	Jul 24, 2018	The R2535X pathogenic variant in the VWF gene has been reported previously and is most commonly associated with autosomal recessive von Willebrand disease type 3 (Schneppenheim et al., 1994; Hampshire et al., 2013; Sanders et al., 2015). However, it has also been identified in the compound heterozygous state in an individual with severe von Willebrand disease type 1 (Michiels et al., 2006). In a family where the index case with von Willebrand disease type 3 was homozygous for the R2535X variant, all other family members were heterozygous for R2535X and displayed VWF values corresponding to von Willebrand disease type 1 (Schneppenheim et al., 1994). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The R2535X variant is observed in 5/126690 (0.004%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts, and no individuals are reported to be homozygous (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret R2535X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000322374.7	VWF	-

310	Likely pathogenic	Apr 03, 2019	The VWF c.4751A>G; p.Tyr1584Cys variant (rs1800386) has been described in individuals and families affected with von Willebrand disease type I (Bowen 2004, James 2007, O'Brien 2003), showing incomplete penetrance in some families (Bowen 2005). It contains an entry in ClinVar (Variation ID: 310), and is observed in the general population at an overall frequency of 0.26% (743/282486 alleles, 4 homozygotes) in the Genome Aggregation Database. The tyrosine at codon 1584 is moderately conserved, and computational algorithms (PolyPhen-2, SIFT) predict that this variant is deleterious. Functional studies indicate that this variant protein results in decreased protein synthesis and increased cellular retention in vitro, with increased susceptibility of VWF proteolysis in vivo (Bowen 2005, O'Brien 2003, Pruss 2011). Based on available information, this variant is considered likely pathogenic. REFERENCES Bowen D et al.

310	Uncertain significance	Mar 07, 2017	The Y1584C variant in the Y1584C gene has been reported as the most common variant seen in individuals with type 1 von Willebrand disease, but is noted to have incomplete penetrance (James et al., 2007; Oâ€™Brien et al., 2003; Goodeve and James, 2014). The Y1584C variant has been shown to co-segregate with susceptibility of von Willebrand factor to proteolysis, however, Y1584C does not always segregate with a clinical diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (Bowen et al., 2005). The Y1584C variant is described as a susceptibility variant, increasing the risk to develop von Willebrand disease type 1, but not sufficient to make a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease in the absence of clinical features (Bowen et al., 2005). The Y1584C variant is observed in 295/66,452 (0.44%) alleles from individuals of European (non-Finnish) background including multiple unrelated homozygous individuals in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). The Y1584C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals. In silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. We interpret Y1584C as a risk allele.	not specified	CN169374:not specified	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000565658.3	VWF	-

Gain-of-function missense or in-frame insertion or deletion variants in this essential binding domain are the sole cause of von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 2B (Goodeve 2010). The p.Pro1266Leu missense variant is usually the result of a gene conversion with a nearby VWF pseudogene and may be present with other variants. The p.Pro1266Leu variant has been reported in at least four studies in which it is found in a total of 11 unrelated individuals with VWD, including in three patients in a homozygous state (all of whom carried additional variants), four patients in a heterozygous state (all of whom carried additional variants in cis or trans), and four in a heterozygous state (Holmberg et al. 1993; Gupta et al. 2008; Federici et al. 2009; Kasatkar et al. 2014).The p.Pro1266Leu variant was found to co-segregate with disease in an autosomal dominant pattern in a large family study (Holmberg et al. 1993). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.002572 in the European (Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Federici et al. (2009) reported that patients carrying the p.Pro1266Leu variant collectively had the lowest bleeding time compared to the other 61 study subjects, as well as one of the lowest bleeding severity scores. Individuals with the p.Pro1266Leu variant are reported to have a normal platelet count, normal platelet morphology, normal VWF protein multimers present in the plasma, but with enhanced platelet aggregation. Functional studies revealed the p.Pro1266Leu variant protein showed levels of protein expression and ability to form dimers comparable to wildtype, but demonstrated platelet aggregation at lower ristocetin concentrations than wildtype, which is consistent with the reported phenotype of the patients (Holmberg et al. 1993). Based on the evidence, the p.Pro1266Leu variant is classified as likely pathogenic for von Willebrand disease. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

314	Pathogenic	Dec 26, 2018	The VWF c.3797C>T; p.Pro1266Leu variant (rs61749370), also known as Pro503Leu, has been described in the literature in individuals with von Willibrand disease (VWD) type 2B, though it is generally reported in individuals with normal VWF multimers (Casonato 2017, Federici 2009, Holmberg 1993, Veyradier 2016, Weiss 1986). This variant has been reported to co-segregate with disease in affected family members (Holmberg 1993, Weiss 1986), and disease is often described as mild (Federici 2009, Holmberg 1993). This variant is also commonly reported in cis to a p.Val1279Ile variant (James 2007). The p.Pro1266Leu variant is reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic by several laboratories in ClinVar (Variation ID: 314), and it is found in the Finnish European population with an overall allele frequency of 0.37% (92/25086 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database. The proline at codon 1266 is moderately conserved but computational programs (PolyPhen2, SIFT) do not reach a consensus as to the effect of this variant on protein function. However, both patient samples and purified protein with the p.Pro1266Leu variant exhibit enhanced ristocitin-induced platelet aggregation relative to wildtype, consistent with type 2B VWD (Holmberg 1993, Weiss 1986). Additionally, another variant at this codon (p.Pro1266Gln) has been described in families with VWD and is considered pathogenic (Casonato 2017, Federici 2009). Based on available information, the p.Pro1266Leu variant is considered to be pathogenic. References: Casonato A et al.

314	Likely pathogenic	Jun 07, 2018	This variant is a missense variant located in the A1 domain of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein. Gain-of-function missense variants in this essential binding domain have been previously reported as causative for von Willebrand disease type 2B (PMID: 28640903).

The variant is present in the gnomAD database at an allele frequency of 0.08% (234/281180), and includes a report of one homozygous individual.

314	Likely pathogenic	Aug 02, 2018	The P1266L variant in the VWF gene has been reported previously, using alternate nomenclature of P503L, in the heterozygous state in multiple unrelated individuals with atypical type 2B von Willebrand disease, which was previously called type New York/type Malmo von Willebrand disease (Holmberg et al., 1993; Federici et al., 2009; Casonato et al., 2010). The P1266L variant is often observed in cis with additional VWF variants due to gene conversion (Holmberg et al., 1993; Eikenboom et al., 1993; Gupta et al., 2005; Federici et al., 2009). The P1266L variant has also been observed in the homozygous state, along with other VWF variants due to gene conversion, in one patient with von Willebrand disease type 3 (Gupta et al., 2005); no additional segregation or phenotypic information was provided for this family. Functional assays indicate that when in the presence of other VWF variants in cis or when P1266L is present alone, this variant is responsible for enhanced platelet reactivity to lower ristocetin concentrations (Holmberg et al., 1993; Gupta et al., 2005). The P1266L variant is observed in 94/25,748 (0.365%) alleles from individuals of European Finnish background, including one homozygous individual, in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). The P1266L variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across mammalian species. We interpret P1266L as a strong candidate for a pathogenic variant; however, the possibility it may be a rare benign variant cannot be completely excluded.

326	Uncertain significance	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change replaces tyrosine with cysteine at codon 652 of the NEXN protein (p.Tyr652Cys). The tyrosine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between tyrosine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs137853197, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported in several individuals affected with dilated cardiomyopathy (PMID: 19881492, 24503780). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 326). Experimental studies have shown that this missense variant destabilizes cardiac Z-disks and leads to a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype (PMID: 19881492). In summary, this variant has been reported in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy and it has been shown to affect cardiac Z-disks stability. However, it has also been observed in the general population. For these reasons, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

326	Uncertain significance	May 18, 2018	The Y652C variant in the NEXN gene has previously been reported in two unrelated German patients with DCM (Hassel et al., 2009); these individuals shared a common haplotype, suggesting a possible founder effect. Y652C was also observed in one Danish individual with suspected sudden cardiac death and non-diagnostic right ventricular hypertrophy (Hertz et al., 2016). In addition, this variant has been identified, both independently and in conjunction with additional cardiogenetic variants, in other unrelated individuals referred for cardiomyopathy genetic testing at GeneDx. However, for these published cases and cases observed at GeneDx, segregation data are not available and/or not sufficient to further clarify the role of this variant in disease. The Y652C variant is observed in 17/125,922 alleles from individuals of European (non-Finnish) ancestry in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016).The Y652C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. Functional studies suggest this missense variant acts in a dominant-negative manner and leads to a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype in zebrafish (Hassel et al., 2009). However, further functional evidence and segregation studies are needed to clarify the role of this variant in human disease.Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is pathogenic or benign.

Functional analysis shows that the S309X protein lacks the coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal LIR motif, which alters protein binding (Khaminets et al., 2015). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. It was not observed in approximately 5,900 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.

This variant has been reported in a family and in an individual affected with neurofibromatosis type 1 (PMID:Â¬â€ 2114220, 12522551).Â¬â€ This variant has been observed to be de novo in an individual suggestive of Noonan syndrome (Invitae).Â¬â€ This variant is also known as 1045C>T in the literature.Â¬â€ ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 334). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

336	Pathogenic	May 17, 2018	This pathogenic variant is denoted NF1 c.4267A>G at the cDNA level, p.Lys1423Glu (K1423E) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Lysine to a Glutamic Acid (AAG>GAG). This variant has been observed in multiple individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome (NF1) and demonstrated complete segregation with disease in one family (Li 1992, Upadhyaya 1997, Upadhyaya 2004, Laycock-van Spyk 2011, Alkindy 2012, Evans 2016). Additionally, NF1 Lys1423Glu was reported in two pediatric patients with a NF1/Noonan syndrome phenotype (De Luca 2005). In vitro functional studies also revealed this variant to have reduced GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity compared to wild type (Li 1992, Poullet 1994, Thomas 2012).NF1 Lys1423Glu was not observed at a significant allele frequency in large population cohorts (NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, The 1000 Genomes Consortium 2015, Lek 2016). Since Lysine and Glutamic Acid differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. NF1 Lys1423Glu occurs at a position that is conserved across species and is located in the Ras-GAP domain (UniProt). In silico analyses predict that this pathogenic variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function. Based on currently available evidence, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.

336	Pathogenic	Jan 07, 2020	This sequence change replaces lysine with glutamic acid at codon 1423 of the NF1 protein (p.Lys1423Glu). The lysine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between lysine and glutamic acid. This variant is present in population databases (rs137854550, ExAC 0.002%). This variant has been reported in several families and individuals affected with neurofibromatosis type 1 (PMID: 1568247, 11857752, 23244495, 16786508). In at least one affected individual, this variant arose de novo (PMID: 27322474). It has also been reported in two individuals affected with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (PMID: 16380919). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 336). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change reduces protein activity 200-400-fold compared with wild type (PMID: 1568247, 22807134), and that the lysine residue is specifically required for normal protein function (PMID: 8264648). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

336	Pathogenic	Jun 09, 2015	The p.Lys1444Glu variant in NF1 (p.Lys1423Glu on transcript NM_000267.3) has bee n previously reported in at least 5 individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 an d segregated with disease in 4 affected family members from 1 family (Li 1992, U padhyaya 1997, Upadhyaya 2004, Laycock-VanSpyke 2011 ). In addition, it has been identified as a somatic variant in individuals with colon adenocarcinoma, anapl astic astrocytoma, and myelodysplasitc syndrome (Li 1992). This variant has also been identified in 1/65426 European chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consor tium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs137854550). Please note that for diseases with variable expressivity, pathogenic variants may be present at a low frequency in the general population. Furthermore, in-vitro functional stud ies provide some evidence that this variant may impact protein function (Li 1992 , Poullet 1994, Thomas 2012). This variant is located in the last three bases of the exon, which is part of the 5? splice region, and computational tools sugges t a possible impact to splicing. However, in vitro assays and computational too ls may not accurately represent biological function. In summary, this variant m eets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for neurofibromatosis type 1 in an autosomal dominant manner (http://www.partners.org/personalizedmedicine/LMM) based upon segregation studies and functional evidence.

This variant has been reported as a recurrent variant observed in many individuals affected with neurofibromatosis type 1 (PMID: 2114220, 7649559, 7903661, 8069310, 8385067, 10076878) including at least one de novo observation (Invitae). This variant is also known as 1087C>T in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 343). Loss-of-function variants in NF1 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 10712197, 23913538). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

The variant is listed in the ClinVar database (Variation ID: 344) as pathogenic by several sources. This variant is absent from general population databases (1000 Genomes Project, Exome Variant Server, and Genome Aggregation Database), indicating it is not a common polymorphism. This variant induces an early termination codon and is predicted to result in a truncated protein or mRNA subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Considering available information, this variant is classified as pathogenic. References: Fahsold R et al.

This variant has been observed in many individuals affected with neurofibromatosis type 1 (PMID: 8664912, 25788518, 18546366, 26969325, 17311297, 17914445). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 346). Loss-of-function variants in NF1 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 10712197, 23913538).

346	Pathogenic	May 31, 2018	The c.1541_1542delAG variant in the NF1 gene has been reported previously as a recurrent pathogenic variant associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (for examples, see Robinson et al., 1996; Brems et al., 2009; Uusitalo et al., 2014; Hutter et al., 2016). The variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Glutamine 514, changes this amino acid to an Arginine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 43 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Gln514ArgfsX43. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). Based on currently available evidence, we consider c.1541_1542delAG to be pathogenic.

347	Likely pathogenic	Feb 06, 2019	This sequence change replaces methionine with arginine at codon 1035 of the NF1 protein (p.Met1035Arg). The methionine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between methionine and arginine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in individuals with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) (Invitae). It has also been reported to be de novo in an individual with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (LEOPARD syndrome) (PMID: 8807336). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 347). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). This variant disrupts the p.Met1035 amino acid residue in NF1. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with NF1-related conditions (PMID: 9042399, 24789688, Invitae), suggesting that it is a clinically significant residue. As a result, variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

353	Pathogenic	Feb 08, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with proline at codon 1276 of the NF1 protein (p.Arg1276Pro). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and proline. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to segregate with neurofibromatosis type 1 in a single family (PMID: 9668168). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 353). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change retained its binding ability to other components, but significantly disabled GAP activity and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, suggesting that the Arg1276Pro functioned as a dominant negative form against the endogenous full-length neurofibromin (PMID: 9668168, 16513807, 26635368). This sequence change falls within a mutational hotspot region, and a different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg1276Gln) has been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 10712197, 15060124, 16479075, 19221814, 23668869, 27322474, 22807134). Arg1276 is known to be a critical catalytic residue in the GAP related domain of NF1, which has been found to interact with Ras and GTP, and is thought to prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation by modulating Ras activity (PMID: 9302992). This suggests that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant segregated with disease in 2 affected family members (Ars 2000 PMID:10607834). This variant is present in 3/245628 individuals of different ethnicities in the Genome Aggregation Database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/rs137854557). Please note, disease causing variants may be present in control databases at low frequencies, reflective of the general population and/or variable expressivity. This variant is present in ClinVar (Variation ID:354). Evolutionary conservation and computational predictive tools for this variant are unclear. Of note, functional studies have shown a deleterious effect of this variant, resulting in the creation of a new splice site (Messiaen 1999 PMID: 11258625, Ars 2000 PMID:10607834, Messiaen 2000 PMID:10862084). In summary, this variant is classified as pathogenic based on the data above (presence of this variant in affected probands, presence as a de novo and predicted impact to protein).

354	Pathogenic	Jan 09, 2020	This sequence change replaces tyrosine with cysteine at codon 489 of the NF1 protein (p.Tyr489Cys). The tyrosine residue is moderately conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between tyrosine and cysteine. The frequency data for this variant (rs137854557) in the population databases is unreliable, as metrics indicate poor quality at this position in the ExAC database. This variant has been observed in multiple individuals affected with neurofibromatosis type 1. It is a recurrent mutation that accounts for as many as 2% of neurofibromatosis type 1 causative alleles (PMID: 11258625, 10607834, 10862084, 10543400, 22155606, 22190595, 19076627). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 354). Experimental studies have shown that this sequence change affects splicing and causes skipping of 62 nucleotides in exon 13 (referred to as exon 10b in the literature). This is expected to alter the reading frame of NF1 and lead to an absent or disrupted protein (PMID: 11258625, 10543400, 10607834).

This variant is reported as pathogenic in ClinVar (Variation ID: 361). It is absent from the general population databases (1000 Genomes Project, Exome Variant Server, and Genome Aggregation Database), indicating it is not a common polymorphism. This variant induces an early termination codon and is predicted to result in a truncated protein or mRNA subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Based on available information, this variant is considered to be pathogenic. REFERENCES Fahsold R et al.

363	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change deletes 3 nucleotides from exon 22 of the NF1 mRNA (c.2970_2972delAAT). This leads to the deletion of 1 amino acid residue in the NF1 protein (p.Met991del) but otherwise preserves the integrity of the reading frame. While this variant is present in population databases (rs267606606, ExAC), the frequency information is unreliable due to low sequence quality at this site. This variant is reported to segregate with disease in several families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (PMID: 17160901) and has been observed in many individuals with NF1-related conditions (PMID: 7904209, 12807981, 17160901, 20602485, 21532985, 23047742). Of note, cutaneous neurofibromas, a major feature of NF1, have not been observed so far in any individuals with this variant (PMID: 17160901). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 363). Experimental studies and prediction algorithms are not available for this variant, and the functional significance of the deleted amino acid is currently unknown. In summary, this variant is a rare in-frame deletion with uncertain impact on protein function. However, this variant has been reported to be a common recurrent mutation in patients with NF1-related conditions. For this reason, it has been classified as Pathogenic.

363	Pathogenic	Dec 15, 2016	The p.Met992del variant in NF1 has been previously reported in >20 individuals w ith NF1, segregated with disease in >20 affected relatives, and was de novo in a t least 1 of these individuals (Upadhyaya 2007, Quintans 2011). Individuals with this variant were reported to not have cutaneous neurofibromas (Upadhyaya 2007, Quintans 2011). This variant has also been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID: 3 63) and has been identified in 1/66338 European chromosomes by the Exome Aggrega tion Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org). This variant is a deleti on of 1 amino acid at position 992 and is not predicted to alter the protein rea ding frame. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as path ogenic for NF1 in an autosomal dominant manner based upon frequency in probands and segregation studies.

363	Pathogenic	Nov 26, 2018	This in-frame deletion of 3 nucleotides in NF1 is denoted c.2970_2972delAAT at the cDNA level and p.Met992del (M992del) at the protein level. The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is AAAC[delAAT]GATG. This deletion of a single Methionine residue occurs at a position that is conserved across species and is not located in a known functional domain (UniProt). This variant has been observed in many individuals with a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and was shown to segregate with disease in multiple large families (Shen 1993, Fahsold 2000, Messiaen 2000, Ars 2003, Castle 2003, De Luca 2005, Griffiths 2007, Upadhyaya 2007, Pros 2008, Muram-Zborovski 2010, Quintans 2011, Ben-Shachar 2013, van Minkelen 2014, Bianchessi 2015, Pasmant 2015, Cali 2016). Importantly, NF1 c.2970_2972delAAT has been suggested to be associated with a milder phenotype than classic NF1. Several reports in the literature suggest that individuals with this variant do not develop a major feature of NF1, cutaneous neurofibromas; rather, the reported phenotypic expression is mainly caf?-au-lait spots and skinfold freckling (Upadhyaya 2007). Only two publications to-date report individuals with NF1 c.2970_2972delAAT and cutaneous neurofibromas (De Luca 2005, Zhu 2016). Based on currently available evidence, we consider this variant to be pathogenic. Although multiple cutaneous neurofibromas are typically characteristic of NF1, absence in affected individuals in the literature suggests that NF1 c.2970_2972delAAT may be associated with a milder clinical presentation. Thus, the risks associated with classic NF1 pathogenic variants cited below might be overestimates and might not apply to this variant or others with an attenuated phenotype. A pathogenic variant in this gene is indicative of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome, a highly penetrant autosomal dominant condition with a birth incidence of approximately 1 in 3000 individuals (Lammert 2005). NF1 is characterized by caf?-au-lait macules, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, and iris Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas). Other manifestations include plexiform neurofibromas, learning disabilities, scoliosis, sphenoid dysplasia, tibial pseudarthrosis and vasculopathy. Brain tumors and optic nerve gliomas, the most common tumors in children with NF1 aside from neurofibromas, are typically benign and reported in approximately 2-3% and 15% of affected individuals, respectively (Ferner 2007). The most common malignant neoplasms associated with NF1 syndrome are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which often develop in adolescence or early adulthood and occur in 6-13% of affected individuals (Evans 2002, McCaughan 2007). The prevalence of pheochromocytomas among individuals with NF1 syndrome is generally reported at 1-5% (Bosch 2006, Zelinka 2007, Toumpanakis 2008, Ferner 2013); however, higher rates have been reported at the time of autopsy (3-13%) (Walther 1999). Several studies have observed a higher than expected incidence of breast cancer in women with NF1 syndrome, particularly under the age of 50 years, and Easton et al. (2015) estimated the lifetime risk to be 26% (Walker 2006, Sharif 2007, Madanikia 2012, Wang 2012, Seminog 2015). While breast cancer in males with NF1 syndrome has been reported, the relative risk compared to the general population is not currently known (Wilson 2004, Seminog 2015). Other neoplasms that are over-represented in patients with NF1 syndrome include gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (Miettinen 2006, Ferner 2013) and childhood leukemia (Stiller 1994, Yoshimi 2010). While the clinical features of NF1 syndrome are highly variable, even within the same family, most affected individuals meet diagnostic criteria in childhood. Approximately half of NF1 cases result from a de novo, rather than an inherited, pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene.

364	Likely pathogenic	Nov 25, 2018	This sequence change deletes 3 nucleotides from exon 32 of the NF1 mRNA (c.4312_4314delGAA). This leads to the deletion of 1 amino acid residue in the NF1 protein (p.Glu1438del) but otherwise preserves the integrity of the reading frame. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in the literature in individuals affected with classic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (PMID: 18546366, 15060124) and an individual with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) (PMID: 12707950). This variant also has been observed as de novo in an individual with multiple spinal ganglioneuromas and cafe-au-lait spots (PMID: 19863548). This variant is also known as 4312 del GAAdE1438 in the literature. ClinVar contain an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 364). This in-frame deletion is located in the GAP-related domain (GRD) of the NF1 protein (PMID: 24413922, 25877329). However, experimental studies and prediction algorithms are not available for this variant, and the functional significance of the deleted amino acid is currently unknown. In summary, this variant is a rare in-frame deletion with uncertain impact on protein function that has been reported in affected individuals including an individual with de novo observation. This evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data is needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

371	Likely pathogenic	Mar 09, 2018	A variant that is likely pathogenic has been identified in the NF1 gene. The L1243P variant has been reported previously in an individual with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 and childhood-onset complex partial seizures (Ferner et al., 2004). The L1243P variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The L1243P variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This variant is located in the GTPase activating protein domain, a critical functional domain (Thomas et. al., 2012). In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. Therefore, this variant is likely pathogenic; however, the possibility that it is benign cannot be excluded.

371	Uncertain significance	Nov 16, 2019	This sequence change replaces leucine with proline at codon 1243 of the NF1 protein (p.Leu1243Pro). The leucine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between leucine and proline. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in an individual affected with neurofibromatosis, type 1 (PMID: 15520408). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 371). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Benign"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

373	Pathogenic	Feb 28, 2018	This sequence change replaces leucine with arginine at codon 844 of the NF1 protein (p.Leu844Arg). The leucine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between leucine and arginine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to be de novo in an individual affected with neurofibromatosis, type 1 (PMID: 15948193) and has been reported in individuals affected with neurofibromatosis, type 1 (PMID: 29290338). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 373). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Leu844Phe) has been determined to be likely pathogenic (PMID: 10980545, 15060124, 27322474). This suggests that the leucine residue is critical for NF1 protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

376	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The CTSA c.746+3A>G variant, also known as the SpDEx7 variant, has been reported in six studies in which it is found in a total of 14 individuals with galactosialidosis, all of Japanese origin, including nine in a homozygous state and five in a compound heterozygous state (Shimmoto et al. 1990; Shimmoto et al. 1993; Zhou et al. 1993; Tatano et al. 2006; Yamazaki et al. 2014; Hossain et al. 2016). Control data are unavailable for this variant which is also not found in the 1000 Genomes Project, the Exome Sequencing Project, or the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies by Shimmoto et al. (1993) have demonstrated that the variant causes aberrant splicing and skipping of exon 7 while allowing the production of a small amount of correctly spliced mRNA. This is thought to result in the milder late-onset phenotype seen in individuals who are homozygous for the variant while a more severe phenotype is seen in individuals who are compound heterozygotes for this variant in combination with different missense variants. Reduced capthepsin activity (one percent of normal levels) was demonstrated in an individual who was a compound heterozygote for the variant (Zhou et al. 1993). Based on the evidence, the c.746+3A>G variant is classified as pathogenic for galactosialidosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

400	Likely pathogenic	Aug 28, 2017	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 378 of the INPP5E protein (p.Arg378Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918130, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been reported to be homozygous in individuals affected with Joubert syndrome (PMID: 19668216). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 400). An experimental study has shown that this missense change disrupts INPP5E phosphatase activity in vitro and in cell culture (PMID: 19668216). In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

401	Pathogenic	Dec 16, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with arginine at codon 78 of the SDHAF2 protein (p.Gly78Arg). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and arginine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to segregate with paraganglioma in multiple families, and is considered a founder mutation in the Dutch population (PMID: 19628817, 21224366, 6286462, 6264239, 21348866). This variant was also observed in an individual with paraganglioma (PMID: 22241717) and a Spanish family, segregating with paraganglioma (PMID: 20071235). The studies have shown a parent-of-origin inheritance pattern (paternal transmission) in these families (PMID: 19628817, 21224366, 20071235, 28099933), but the clinical significance of this is not established yet. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 401). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change impairs interaction with SDHA, reduces protein stability, and decreases SDHA flavination (PMID: 19628817, 24414418). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

401	Pathogenic	Sep 06, 2017	This variant is denoted SDHAF2 c.232G>A at the cDNA level, p.Gly78Arg (G78R) at the protein level,and results in the change of a Glycine to an Arginine (GGA>AGA). This variant has been reported in association withhereditary paraganglioma and is described as a Dutch founder pathogenic variant (Hao 2009, Bayley 2010, Kunst2011, Hensen 2012, Bausch 2017). Functional assays of SDHAF2 Gly78Arg have shown this variant results in adestabilized SDHAF2 protein and impairs SDHAF2-SDHA interaction (Hao 2009, Bezawork-Gelata 2014). SDHAF2Gly78Arg was not observed in large population cohorts (NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, The 1000 GenomesConsortium 2015, Lek 2016). Since Glycine and Arginine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this isconsidered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. SDHAF2 Gly78Arg occurs at a position that is conservedacross species and is not located in a known functional domain. In silico analyses predict that this variant is probablydamaging to protein structure and function. Based on currently available evidence, we consider this variant to bepathogenic. Of note, variants in the SDHAF2 gene exhibit a parent-of-origin effect and, if shown to be pathogenic,typically cause symptoms only if inherited from the father	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000617571.2	SDHAF2	-

It has also been observed to segregate with disease in related individuals. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 402).

This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The R57X variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret R57X as a pathogenic variant.

411	Likely pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The homozygous p.His158ProfsTer8 variant in TACO1 was identified by our study in one individual with Mitochondrial Complex IV Deficiency. This variant was absent from large population studies. The homozygous p.His158ProfsTer8 variant in TACO1 has been reported in 5 Turkish individuals with Mitochondrial Complex IV Deficiency, and segregated with disease in 5 affected relatives from one cosanguineous family. Seven additional relatives, 1 without the variant and 6 with the variant in the heterozygous state, were unaffected (PMID: 19503089). This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, which alters the protein's amino acid sequence beginning at position 158 and leads to a premature termination codon 8 amino acids downstream. This alteration is then predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. However, loss of function of the TACO1 gene is not an established disease mechanism in autosomal recessive Mitochrondrial Complex IV Deficiency based on the criteria laid out in Tayoun, 2018 (PMID: 30192042). In vitro functional studies with fibroblast mitochondria from a patient homozygous for this variant provide some evidence that the p.His158ProfsTer8 variant may impact protein function since Mitochondrial Complex IV levels were rescued by wild-type TACO1 expression (PMID: 19503089). However, these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, this variant is likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM2, PS3, PP1 (Richards 2015).

431	Pathogenic	Oct 11, 2018	Variant summary: COQ9 c.730C>T (p.Arg244X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 1.2e-05 in 246562 control chromosomes (gnomAD and publication). c.730C>T has been reported in the literature in a homozygous individual affected with Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary, 5 (Duncan_2009). This data indicates that the variant may be associated with disease. The variant has been functionally assessed and found to have ~10% of the normal coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis rate, and the generation of a homozygous mouse model with the orthologous variant R239X showed a severe CoQ10 deficiency. A ClinVar submission from the reputable database, GeneReviews (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

432	Pathogenic	Jul 24, 2017	The c.1905+1G>A pathogenic variant in the DPYD gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in individuals with variable features of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, but has also been reported homozygous in asymptomatic individuals (Vreken et al., 1996; Au et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2015). The c.1905+1G>A variant (also referred to as DPYD*2A) is also one of the most common DPYD variants reported in association with toxicity to 5-fluorouracil, both in the heterozygous and biallelic state (Kleibl et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2002; Falvella et al., 2015). The c.1905+1G>A splice site variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 14. Functional studies demonstrate that this variant leads to a 165-bp deletion (corresponding to exon 14) of the DPYD mRNA, which is translated into a nonfunctional DPYD protein (Vreken et al., 1996; Johnson et al., 2002; Offer et al., 2013). The c.1905+1G>A variant is observed in 144/6,608 (2.21%) alleles from individuals of European (Finnish) background including multiple unrelated homozygous individuals in the ExAC dataset, which is greater than expected for this disorder (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.1905+1G>A as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329338.5	DPYD	-

432	Pathogenic	Jun 14, 2016	Across a selection of available literature, the c.1905+1G>A variant has been reported in at least 30 patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, including in at least four patients in a homozygous state and in 26 patients in a heterozygous state, all of whom had 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity (Vreken et al. 1996; Van Kuilenburg et al. 1999; Van Kuilenburg et al. 2002; Morel et al. 2006; Magne et al. 2007). The c.1905+1G>A variant was found in one of 74 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.02209 in the European (Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The DPYD c.1905+1G>A variant occurs in a canonical splice site (donor) and results in skipping of exon 14 leading to an inactive DPYD allele (Wei et al. 1996). In patients with the c.1905+1G>A variant in a heterozygous state, conversion of 5-FU was shown to be 40% lower compared to controls (Van Kuilenburg et al. 2012). Based on the collective evidence, the c.1905+1G>A variant is classified as pathogenic for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.

449	Uncertain significance	May 05, 2017	The R158C variant in the CCBE1 gene has been reported previously, in the compound heterozygous state with a frameshift CCBE1 variant, in an individual with Hennekam syndrome (Alders et al., 2009). However, zebrafish modeling of this variant shows activity comparable to wild-type, and in vitro studies demonstrate that the R158C variant does not affect the ability of CCBE1 to activate VEGFC processing (Alders et al., 2009; Roukens et al., 2015). The R158C variant is observed in 22/66708 (0.033%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). Although this substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved, the R158C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. We interpret R158C as a variant of uncertain significance.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000581937.4	CCBE1	-

453	Likely pathogenic	Jun 26, 2017	The K404E variant in the CPOX gene has been reported previously along with another variant in an individual with harderoporphyria with severe hemolytic anemia with splenomegaly and compensatory hyperactive bone marrow. Carrier parents and sister were clinically unaffected but showed a decrease in CPOX activity (Lamoril et al., 1998). The K404E variant, also referred to as K304E using alternate nomenclature, was also reported in three siblings with harderoporphyria. The variant was assumed to be homozygous due to absence of the normal allele and decreased CPOX enzyme activity in the affected siblings, and the heterozygous state of the father along with parental enzyme studies demonstrating heterozygosity for the same enzymatic defect in both parents. DNA was not obtained from the mother (Lamoril et al., 1995). In functional studies, the K404E mutant enzyme exhibits reduced enzyme activity compared to wild type enzyme (Kim et al., 2013; Lamoril et al., 1995). The K404E variant is observed in 4/66724 (0.006%) alleles in the ExAC dataset, and no homozygous individuals were reported (Lek et al., 2016). The K404E variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. We interpret K404E as a likely pathogenic variant.

454	Pathogenic	Jan 14, 2016	The c.127_131dupGCAGC variant in the CPOX gene has been reported previously using alternate nomenclature 129ins5 in a patient with coproporphyria (Lamoril et al., 1997). The c.127_131dupGCAGC variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Glycine 45, changes this amino acid to a Glutamine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 93 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Gly45GlnfsX93. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The c.127_131dupGCAGC variant was not observed in approximately 767 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret c.127_131dupGCAGC as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000568843.4	CPOX	-

459	Uncertain significance	Nov 06, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 447 of the CPOX protein (p.Arg447Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs28931603, ExAC 0.1%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with coproporphyria, though some of those individuals had a second variant that could have contributed to the condition (PMID: 11309681, 12181641, 27959697). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 459). This variant has been reported to affect CPOX protein function (PMID: 11309681). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

464	Pathogenic	Jan 09, 2020	This sequence change replaces alanine with proline at codon 150 of the ALDOB protein (p.Ala150Pro). The alanine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between alanine and proline. This variant is present in population databases (rs1800546, ExAC 0.4%). This variant is known as the most common mutation in the ALDOB gene. It has been reported as homozygous or in combination with other ALDOB variants in many individuals affected with inherited fructose intolerance and in families with evidence of disease co-segregation (PMID: 3383242, 8096362, 19768653, 15880727, 18541450, 27797444).

464	Pathogenic	Jul 10, 2017	The A150P variant is the most common ALDOB pathogenic variant among individuals of European ancestry; it has been observed numerous times (also reported as A149P due to alternate nomenclature), either in the homozygous or in the compound heterozygous state with another pathogenic variant, in individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance (Cross et al., 1988; Santer et al., 2005; Davit-Spraul et al., 2008). The NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project reports A150P was observed in 43/8600 alleles from individuals of European background; no individuals in this control population were homozygous for this variant. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals. In vitro functional analyses have indicated that the A150P substitution decreases substrate affinity and enzyme stability; additionally, ALDOB protein harboring this substitution showed loss of thermostability and significantly lower activity than wild type protein (Esposito et al., 2002; Malay et al., 2002). X-ray crystallography shows that this variant results in extensive structural perturbation at the site of the substitution and in the adjacent loop regions (Malay et al., 2005). We interpret A150P as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000322438.6	ALDOB	-

464	Pathogenic	Mar 21, 2018	The p.Ala150Pro variant in ALDOB (frequently referred to as p.Ala149Pro) is the most common hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) allele, accounting for approxi mately half of HFI alleles identified worldwide (Cross 1988, Cross and Cox 1989, Malay 2005). In vitro functional studies also provide evidence that the p.Ala15 0Pro variant impacts protein function (Esposito 2002, Malay 2002, Malay 2005). T his variant has been identified in 0.47% (604/126366) of European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSN P rs1800546). Although it has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for HFI in an autosom al recessive manner based upon functional evidence and biallelic occurrence in a ffected individuals.

464	Pathogenic	May 17, 2018	The ALDOB c.448G>C (p.Ala150Pro) variant is well-documented as one of the most common variants among patients with hereditary fructose intolerance in European and North American populations (Baker et al. 2015). Across a small selection of the available literature, the p.Ala150Pro variant was identified in a homozygous state in 44 patients, in a compound heterozygous state in 33 patients, and in a heterozygous state in three unaffected family members of a patient (Cross et al. 1988; Coffee et al. 2010). Control data are not reported in these studies for this variant, which is found at a frequency of 0.00895 in the European population from the 1000 Genomes Project. The ALDOB p.Ala150Pro variant protein, extracted from liver and intestinal tissues from a homozygous patient, showed a profound reduction in substrate affinity and specific activity when compared with control subjects (Cox et al. 1983), and in vitro functional studies of ALDOB variants demonstrated that the p.Ala150Pro variant protein was highly unstable with no detectable residual enzyme activity (Esposito et al. 2002). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ala150Pro variant is classified as pathogenic for hereditary fructose intolerance. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

This variant was found in 40/121278 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0003298, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic ALDOB variant (0.0044721). It was reported in several Hereditary Fructose Intolerance patients in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity with other potentially pathogenic ALDOB variants suggesting pathogenicity. A functional study reported the variant to result in insoluble form of the ALDB protein when expressed in E.Coli indicating that structural perturbations produced by the variant affects the overall integrity of the enzyme. Moreover, the variant is known to be a common disease causing mutation accounting for about 70-80% of all HFI alleles worldwide (PMID: 20848650).

465	Pathogenic	Feb 21, 2018	The A175D variant in the ALDOB gene has been observed numerous times (also reported as A174D due to alternate nomenclature), either in the homozygous or in the compound heterozygous state with another pathogenic variant, in individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance (Cross et al., 1990; Ferri et al., 2012; Valadares et al., 2015). The A175D variant is observed in 18/10,146 alleles (0.17%) from individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish background, and 94/276,618 global alleles (0.034%) with no homozygous control individuals reported, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The A175D variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect, and structural studies indicate that the A175D variant may alter the structural and functional integrity of the aldolase B enzyme by introducing a polar residue into a hydrophobic environment (Esposito et al., 2002). We interpret A175D as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000330017.6	ALDOB	-

472	Pathogenic	Nov 09, 2017	Variant summary: The ALDOB c.178C>T (p.Arg60X) variant results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncated or absent ALDOB protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. This variant was found in 20/277036 control chromosomes (gnomAD) at a frequency of 0.0000722, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic ALDOB variant (0.0044721). Multiple publications have cited the variant in affected compound heterozygote and homozygote patients. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as likely pathogenic/pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

472	Pathogenic	Dec 27, 2018	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Arg60*) in the ALDOB gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs118204429, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been observed to segregate with hereditary fructose intolerance in a family (PMID: 8071980) and has been reported in individuals affected with hereditary fructose intolerance (PMID: 8299883, 26937407, 8071980,Â¬â€ 15880727, 20882353). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 472). Experimental studies have shown that this nonsense change produces an ALDOB protein that has null enzyme activity (PMID: 8299883). Loss-of-function variants in ALDOB are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 18541450). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

472	Pathogenic	Jul 25, 2018	The R60X variant in the ALDOB gene has been reported previously in association with hereditary fructose intolerance, when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another disease-causing variant (Ali et al., 1994; Santer et al., 2005; Davit-Spraul et al., 2008; Valadares et al., 2015). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The R60X variant is observed in 20/277036 (0.007%) alleles in large population cohorts and no individuals were reported to be homozygous (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret R60X as a pathogenic variant.

477	Uncertain significance	Nov 12, 2018	The PTS c.46C>T (p.Arg16Cys) missense variant has been reported in one study in which it is found in a compound heterozygous state with a frameshift variant in one individual with 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase deficiency (ThÃ¶ny et al. 1994). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.000067 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database but this is based on one allele only and is presumed to be rare. Characterization of patient fibroblasts revealed PTS activity equivalent to one percent of wild type and heterologous expression of the p.Arg16Cys enzyme in E. coli showed similar expression levels but only seven percent enzyme activity of wild type (ThÃ¶ny et al. 1994). Expression of variant p.Arg16Cys and the mouse equivalent (mPTPSp.Arg15Cys) in COS-1 cells revealed significantly reduced PTS activity and in vivo radioactive labelling experiments showed that wild PTS was phosphorylated but the p.Arg16Cys was not (Oppliger et al. 1995; Korner et al. 2016). Mice that were homozygous or compound heterozygous for variant p.Arg16Cys had reduced PTPS activity (Korner et al. 2016). Based on the evidence, the p.Arg16Cys variant is classified as a variant of uncertain significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

479	Pathogenic	Oct 17, 2019	This sequence change replaces asparagine with serine at codon 52 of the PTS protein (p.Asn52Ser). The asparagine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between asparagine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894275, ExAC 0.2%). This variant is one of the most common PTS deficiency mutation in Southern Chinese population (PMID: 11438997). It has been reported as compound heterozygous (in trans) and as homozygous in multiple individuals and families affected with PTS deficiency and segregates with disease (PMID: 8707300, 17160954, 9450907). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 479). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

480	Pathogenic	Aug 05, 2019	This sequence change replaces proline with serine at codon 87 of the PTS protein (p.Pro87Ser). The proline residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894276, ExAC 0.08%). This variant has been observed in multiple individuals and families affected with PTS-related conditions (PMID: 8707300, 21933604, 11694255). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 480). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change leads to reduced PTS activity (PMID: 10319579). This variant disrupts the p.Pro87 amino acid residue in PTS. Other variants that disrupt this residue have been observed in affected individuals (PMID: 11694255, 10319579, 19350512, 7493990, 11388593), suggesting that it is a clinically significant residue. As a result, variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant has been observed in combination with anotherÂ¬â€ PTSÂ¬â€ variant in multiple individuals affected withÂ¬â€ biopterin deficient hyperphenylalanemiaÂ¬â€ (PMID: 9450907, 23138986). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 481). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function output the following: SIFT: "Tolerated"; PolyPhen-2: "Benign"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0". The methionine amino acid residue is found in multiple mammalian species, suggesting that this missense change does not adversely affect protein function. These predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation. Furthermore, the Y3156X variant was not observed in approximately 2,200 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.

540	Pathogenic	Dec 12, 2018	The c.317-2A>G variant in the TMEM70 gene is a common pathogenic variant in patients of Roma (Gypsy) origin with mitochondrial complex V deficiency, and it has also been reported in non-Roma patients (CÃ­zkovÃ¡ et al. 2008; HonzÃ­k et al. 2010; Tort et al. 2011). cDNA analysis found that c.317-2A>G leads to abnormal splicing and loss of normal TMEM70 transcript (CÃ­zkovÃ¡ et al. 2008). The c.317-2A>G variant is observed in 4/11,508 (0.03%) alleles from individuals of Latino background and 8/66,524 (0.01%) alleles from individuals of European (non-Finnish) background in the ExAC dataset, and no individuals were reported to be homozygous (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.317-2 A>G as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329823.6	TMEM70	-
540	Pathogenic	Aug 22, 2018	The TMEM70 c.317-2A>G variant occurs in a canonical splice site (acceptor) and is therefore predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product.Across a selection of available literature, the c.317-2A>G variant has been reported in a homozygous state in 36 probands with mitochondrial complex V (ATP Synthase) deficiency, nuclear type (Cizkova et al. 2008; Tort et al. 2011; Braczynski et al. 2015). Cizkova et al. (2008) further demonstrated segregation of the c.317-2A>G variant in six families, in which all the affected individuals were homozygous, all parents were heterozygous, and unaffected siblings were either wild type or heterozygous for the variant. The c.317-2A>G variant was absent from 101 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00035 in the Latino population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The c.317-2A>G variant occurs at a canonical splice site and has been shown to result in aberrant splicing and loss of the transcript (Cizkova et al. 2008; Hejzlarova et al. 2011). Functional studies using fibroblasts from probands harboring the c.317-2A>G variant showed a significant deficiency in ATP synthase compared with control cells, and ultrastructural analysis revealed defects in mitochondrial morphology (HavlÃ­ÄkovÃ¡ KarbanovÃ¡ et al. 2012; Braczynski et al. 2015). Based on the collective evidence, the c.317-2A>G variant is classified as pathogenic for mitochondrial complex V (ATP Synthase) deficiency, nuclear type. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

543	Pathogenic	Aug 09, 2018	The p.Arg81Gln variant in LRTOMT has been reported in 16 North African (Tunisian and Moroccan) probands with hearing loss, and segregated with hearing loss in > 20 family members, all of whom were homozygous for the variant (Ahmed 2008, Char if 2008). The variant was detected in 5/430 (1.2%) ethnically matched control ch romosomes, however its frequency in the probands (13.8%, 32/232 chromosomes) is significantly higher, which supports a causative role for the variant, and sugge sts that the variant may represent a founder mutation in these populations. In a ddition, computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that t his variant may impact the protein. The variant has also been identified in 3/57 674 European chromosomes by the genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnom ad.broadinstitute.org/). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classifie d as pathogenic for hearing loss in an autosomal recessive manner based upon seg regation studies and enrichment in cases.

563	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The SLC29A3 c.1279G>A (p.Gly427Ser) variant is a missense variant that has been reported in three studies in which it is found in a total of 13 patients with cutaneous hyperpigmentation with hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, heart anomalies, hearing loss and hypogonadism, including in ten in a homozygous state and in three in a compound heterozygous state (including two siblings) (Molho-Pessach et al. 2008; Spiegel et al. 2010; Al-Haggar et al. 2015). The p.Gly427Ser variant was found in a heterozygous state in four of 362 geographically and ethnically matched chromosomes in the Arab population of the study but was absent from 60 chromosomes from individuals of Jewish origin and 76 control chromosomes from individuals of European or Bulgarian origin (Molho-Pessach et al. 2008). The p.Gly427Ser variant is reported at a frequency of 0.00002 in the East Asian population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that the variant results in a total loss of transport activity (Kang et al. 2010). Based on the evidence, the p.Gly427Ser variant is classified as pathogenic for cutaneous hyperpigmentation with hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, heart anomalies, hearing loss and hypogonadism. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

564	Likely pathogenic	Aug 25, 2017	The E444X variant in the SLC29A3 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in an individual with pigmented hypertrichosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and pancreatomegaly; this variant was not observed in over 100 ethnically matched control chromosomes (Cliffe et al., 2009). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation, as the last 32 amino acids of the protein are lost. While not present in the homozygous state, the E444X variant is observed in 5/16510 (0.03%) alleles from individuals of South Asian background in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret E444X as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000490811.2	SLC29A3	-

564	Likely pathogenic	Dec 23, 2019	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the SLC29A3 gene (p.Glu444*). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 32 amino acids of the SLC29A3 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs267607056, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been observed in an individual affected with pigmented hypertrichotic dermatosis with insulin-dependent diabetes (PHID) syndrome (PMID: 17461801, 19336477). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 564). This variant has been reported to affect SLC29A3 protein function (PMID:20595384). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. This variant disrupts a region of the protein in which other variant(s), p.Glu447Lys and p.Thr449Arg, have been observed in individuals with SLC29A3-related conditions (PMID: 28554179, 19336477, 20595384). This suggests that this may be a clinically significant region of the SLC29A3 protein. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

565	Pathogenic	Jun 21, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with arginine at codon 437 of the SLC29A3 protein (p.Gly437Arg). The glycine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and arginine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121912584, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been observed to segregate with H syndrome and pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin dependent diabetes (PHID) in several families (PMID: 18940313, 20619369, 29041934). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 565). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change (p.G437R) reduces hENT3 nucleoside transport activity and impairs protein stability (PMID: 20595384). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

565	Pathogenic	Dec 12, 2016	The G437R variant in the SLC29A3 gene has been reported previously in individuals with SLC29A3-related disorders who were homozygous for the G437R variant or heterozygous for the G437R variant and heterozygous for a second SLC29A3 variant (Molho-Pessach et al., 2008; Spiegel et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2010). The G437R variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The G437R variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies of G437R indicate that it leads to decreased stability of the mutant protein (Kang et al., 2010). As an alternate mechanism, multiple in silico algorithms predict that this sequence change might create a cryptic splice acceptor site in exon 6 which may supplant the natural acceptor site. However, in the absence of RNA/functional studies, the actual effect of this sequence change on splicing is unknown. We interpret G437R as a pathogenic variant.

576	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	Across a selection of the available literature, the PAH c.1315+1G>A variant, which occurs in a canonical splice site (donor) and is therefore predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product, is noted as one of the prevalent variants in the PAH gene. This variant has been identified in a homozygous state in at least 22 individuals with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, in a compound heterozygous state in 151 patients, and in a heterozygous state in two patients (Guldberg et al. 1998; Koch et al. 2002; Bell et al. 2011; Bayat et al. 2016). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00105 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. The c.1315+1G>A variant was shown to cause skipping of exon 11, leading to loss of protein function (Marvit et al. 1987; Heintz et al. 2013; Couce et al. 2013). Based on the evidence from the literature and the potential impact of splice donor variants, the c.1315+1G>A variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

One in-silico tool predicts damaging outcome for this variant and 5/5 splice-tools in Alamut predict that this variant abolishes a splice donor site at intron 12. This variant is found in 42/121228 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0003465, which does not exceed maximal expected frequency of a pathogenic allele (0.0079057). The variant has been reported in numerous affected individuals in the literature, is considered a common pathogenic variant in European populations, and has been shown to results in the complete absence of PAH activity. In addition, multiple reputable clinical labs have classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant was classified as pathogenic.

576	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in the last intron (intron 12) of the PAH gene. While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it likely alters RNA splicing and results in a disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs5030861, ExAC 0.06%). This variant has been reported as homozygous or in combination with other PAH variants in multiple individuals affected with phenylketonuria, being a common cause of the disease in European populations (PMID: 9634518, 25596310, 26542770, 24368688, Invitae). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 576). Nucleotide substitutions within the consensus splice site are a relatively common cause of aberrant splicing (PMID: 17576681, 9536098). Experimental studies have shown that this variant causes exon 12 skipping. The resulting truncated protein is unstable and does not show any PAH activity (PMID: 3615198). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

577	Pathogenic	Dec 07, 2016	Variant summary: The c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Trp) in PAH gene is a missense change that involves a non-conserved nucleotide and 5/5 in silico tools predict deleterious outcome. The variant of interest is located within the catalytic domain and mutations were proven to lead to severe aggregation and complete disruption of structural integrity, and, as a result, complete abolishment of all residual enzyme activity. The variant is present in the large control population dataset of ExAC at a frequency 0.00066 (80/121328 chrs tested), predominantly in individuals of European descent (0.0011; 74/66718) which does not exceed the maximal expected frequency of a pathogenic allele (0.0079) in this gene. The variant has been identified homozygously or in the compound heterozygous state in numerous affected individuals with severe presentation. It is listed as the most common missense pathogenic variant in European population. Lastly, multiple reputable databases/diagnostic centers classified the variant of interest as Pathogenic. Taken together, the variant was classified as Pathogenic.

577	Pathogenic	Mar 24, 2017	The R408W missense variant in the PAH gene has been reported as a pathogenic variant in the PAH Consortium database. The R408W variant is considered a severe PAH pathogenic variant. Patients homozygous for the R408W variant have classic PKU and functional analysis found that it is associated with significantly reduced enzyme activity (Guldberg et al., 1998; Okano et al., 1991). The R408W variant is classified as not responsive to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) therapy (Zurfluh et al. 2008).

577	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The PAH c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Trp) variant is a well-documented missense variant that has been identified in many patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (DiLella et al. 1987; ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008). Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Arg408Trp variant has been identified in a homozygous state in 24 patients and in a compound heterozygous state in at least 106 patients (KaraciÄ‡ et al. 2009; Utz et al. 2012; Sterl et al. 2013). Control data are not available from thse studies for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00174 in the European-American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Functional studies in E coli with p.Arg408Trp-PAH or wild type PAH demonstrated that the p.Arg408Trp-PAH formed high molecular weight aggregates, suggesting a severe folding defect (Gersting et al. 2008). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg408Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

577	Pathogenic	Dec 27, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with tryptophan at codon 408 of the PAH protein (p.Arg408Trp). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and tryptophan. This variant is present in population databases (rs5030858, ExAC 0.1%). This variant is the most prevalent and widely distributed PKU-causing allele in the European population (PMID: 2014036, 8097262, 12173030, 25596310, 23430547). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 577). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change results in reduced protein stability and accelerated degradation, and an enzyme lack of residual activity (PMID: 18538294, 17935162, 19036622, 12655546, 2014036, 21953985, 18937047). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

577	Pathogenic	Aug 13, 2015	The c.1222C>T (p. Arg408Trp) missense variant in the PAH gene has been shown to segregate with PKU in a family, wherein the affected individual was found to be homozygous [DiLella AG et al., (1987)]. This variant is predominantly found in the Eastern European population who were diagnosed with PKU [Zschocke J, (2003)]. The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence in controls [ZurflÃ¼h MR et al., (2008)]. Furthermore, protein-expression studies in E.coli, using human cDNA containing this variant, showed 100% protein aggregation, which suggests a severe folding defect and loss of function [Gersting SW et al., (2008)]. The frequency of this variant in the population databases (1000Genome, Exome Sequencing Project and ExAC) is lower than the disease-allele frequency and there are no homozygotes present. Several computational algorithms predict a deleterious effect of this variant on the protein. Finally, a reputable source has also classified this variant as Pathogenic. Therefore, the collective evidence supports a classification of the c.1222C>T (p. Arg408Trp) variant in the PAH gene as Pathogenic. We have confirmed this finding in our laboratory using Sanger sequencing.

580	Pathogenic	Feb 15, 2018	Variant summary: PAH c.838G>A (p.Glu280Lys) results in a conservative amino acid change located in the C-terminal domain of the Aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (IPR019774) of the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The c.838G>A variant has been reported in the literature in several individuals affected with Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria) either in a homozygous state or in a compound heterozygosity with other HPA variants considered as pathogenic (e.g. Pey 2003, Kayaalp 1997, Couce 2013, Aldamiz-Echevarria 2016). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. Publications also reported experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function, concluding that the variant affected both folding and catalysis (Pey 2003). The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity. One study reported absent/minimal BH4 responsiveness for patients carrying the variant (Couce 2013). Four clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. All laboratories classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

584	Pathogenic	Apr 26, 2018	Variant summary: PAH c.754C>T (p.Arg252Trp) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Aromatic amino acid hydroxylase, C-terminal of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.9e-05 in 121328 control chromosomes (ExAC). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in PAH causing Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria) (4.9e-05 vs 0.0079), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.754C>T, has been reported in the literature in numerous individuals affected with Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria) in both the compound heterozygous and homozygous states (Aldmiz-Echevarra_2016, Dobrowolski_2011, Jeannesson-Thivisol_2015) and enzyme activity has been reported in patients as <10% of normal activity. Three clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. All laboratories classified the variant as pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

588	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The PAH c.727C>T (p.Arg243Ter) variant is a stop gained variant that is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Arg243Ter variant has been identified in a total of 20 patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency leading to phenylketonuria, including in ten in a homozygous state and in ten in a compound heterozygous state (Wang et al. 1990; Ramus et al. 1993; ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008; Zare-Karizi et al. 2011; Spaapen et al. 2011; Couce et al. 2013; Bashyam et al. 2014). Control data are unavailable for this variant from these studies, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00009 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Patients with the p.Arg243Ter variant showed reduced enzyme activity of < 1% of wild type (ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008; Couce et al. 2013). Based on the collective evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Arg243Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

590	Pathogenic	Dec 13, 2018	Variant summary: PAH c.611A>G (p.Tyr204Cys) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Aromatic amino acid hydroxylase, C-terminal domain of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. Several computational tools predict a significant impact on normal splicing: Four predict the variant creates a 5' donor site. One publication reports experimental evidence showing that this variant affects mRNA splicing resulting in a 32-amino acid deletion in the core region of the PAH enzyme (Ellingsen_1997). The variant allele was found at a frequency of 1.2e-05 in 246108 control chromosomes (gnomAD). The variant, c.611A>G, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria) (Tao_2015, Liang_2014, Song_2005, Ellingsen_1997). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. A ClinVar submission from a clinical diagnostic laboratory (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as pathogenic.

593	Pathogenic	Jan 02, 2020	This sequence change replaces tyrosine with cysteine at codon 414 of the PAH protein (p.Tyr414Cys). The tyrosine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between tyrosine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs5030860, ExAC 0.08%). This variant is the most common mild phenylketonuria (PKU) mutation in Europe, being especially frequent in the Scandinavian population and has been found to be associated with a range of clinical phenotypes (PMID: 12655544, 20063067, 23764561). It has been found as homozygous in individuals affected with mild PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (PMID: 8556304, 9399896, 23764561). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 593). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes a mild decrease of the PAH enzymatic activity (PMID: 10479481, 17935162, 18538294, 19036622). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

593	Pathogenic	Apr 25, 2016	The p.Tyr414Cys variant in PAH is a well-established pathogenic variant for PKU and has been reported in more than 25 individuals with PKU in a homozygous state or compound heterozygous state with another pathogenic variant (Okano 1991, Nie lsen 2010, Couce 2013). This variant led to reduced enzyme activity in in vitro studies (Okano 1991, Benit 1999, Zurfluh 2008). The p.Tyr414Cys variant has been identified in 0.05% (60/121,344) of chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consor tium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs5030860) though this frequen cy is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary , this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PKU in an a utosomal recessive manner based upon case observations and functional evidence.

Thec.442-1 G>A variant destroys the canonical splice acceptor site in intron 4, and is expected to causeabnormal gene splicing. The c.442-1 G>A variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek etal., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). It is unclear whether or notc.442-1 G>A is responsive to BH4 therapy (Zurfluh et al., 2008). In summary, we interpret c.442-1G>A as pathogenic.

It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. Loss-of-function variants in PAH are known to be pathogenic. This particular variant has been reported in several individuals affected with phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia, being described as a common cause of the disease in Asia. In the homozygous state it has been associated with the classical form of phenylketonuria (PMID: 9860305, 10471838, 24301756, 26322415, 26600521, 26666653). Experimental studies have shown that this variant also leads to out-of-frame skipping of exon 11 of the PAH gene (PMID: 7915167, 10471838).

The Y356X variant is predicted tocause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decayand is expected to be associated with a classic phenylketonuria phenotype as expression studies found thatthis variant is associated with very low residual phenylalanine hydroxylase activity compared to wild-type(Liang et al., 2014; Zurfluh et al., 2008). The Y356X variant was found to not be responsive totetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) therapy (Zurfluh et al., 2008). Therefore, we interpret this variant as pathogenic.

596	Pathogenic	Aug 31, 2018	Variant summary: PAH c.814G>T (p.Gly272X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 5.1e-05 in 277088 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in PAH causing Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria) (5.1e-05 vs 0.0079), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.814G>T has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria)(Jeannesson-Thivisol_2015, Aldamiz-Echevarria_2016). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. The variant was found to cause a loss of enzyme activity via functional studies (Aldamiz-Echevarria_2016). Three ClinVar submissions from other clinical diagnostic laboratories (evaluation after 2014) cite the variant as "pathogenic." Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

The G272X variant has also been reported in a patient with classic PKU in the homozygous state (Williams et al., 2015). The G272X variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

598	Pathogenic	Dec 07, 2019	This sequence change replaces serine with phenylalanine at codon 273 of the PAH protein (p.Ser273Phe). The serine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between serine and phenylalanine. This variant is present in population databases (rs62514953, ExAC 0.001%). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with phenylketonuria (PMID: 24368688, Invitae). In at least one individual the data is consistent with the variant being in trans (on the opposite chromosome) from a pathogenic variant. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 598). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. This variant disrupts the p.Ser273 amino acid residue in PAH. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with PAH-related conditions (PMID: 11142755), which suggests that this may be a clinically significant amino acid residue. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant has been reported as homozygous or in combination with another PAH variant in individuals and several families affected with phenylketonuria (PMID: 24941924, 16256386, 20188615, 23764561). This variant is also known as IVS VII-1G>A and IVS7+1G>A in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 599). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in PAH are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 1301187, 9634518). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

601	Pathogenic	Oct 08, 2019	This sequence change affects codon 399 of the PAH mRNA. It is a 'silent' change, meaning that it does not change the encoded amino acid sequence of the PAH protein. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in combination with other PAH variants in individuals affected with PAH-related disease (PMID: 24401910, 27264808). This variant has also been observed on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from other pathogenic variants in individuals affected with PAH-related disease (PMID: 11214902, Invitae). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 601). Experimental studies have shown that this silent change causes aberrant RNA splicing and exon skipping (PMID: 11214902). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

601	Pathogenic	Aug 05, 2016	Variant summary: The PAH c.1197A>T (p.Val399Val) variant involves the alteration of a non-conserved nucleotide, resulting in a synonymous change. It is located three nucleotides upstream from exon-intron boundary and is predicted to be damaging by MutationTaster. In addition, 2/5 tools predict the variant to attenuate the splice donor site while 4/5 tools predict the variant to attenuate the cryptic splice site located at upstream to this variant position. Functional study by patients RNA analysis as well as minigene assay proves that this variant is a splicing mutation causing skipping of exon 11 (Chao_2001). This variant was found in 15/121712 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0001232, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic PAH variant (0.0079057). This variant is a common pathogenic variant causing classical PKH, especially in Chinese and/or Taiwanese population with consistent clinical data. The carrier rate of this variant in Han Chinese population was 3.2% in a study that enrolled 212 controls (Zhu_2010). Multiple reputable databases have classified this variant as pathogenic.

605	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The PAH c.117C>G (p.Phe39Leu) missense variant is well-described in the literature and has been identified individuals with varying phenotypes, ranging from classic phenylketonuria (PKU) to untreated hyperphenylalaninemia with normal intelligence (Forrest et al. 1991; Tyfield et al. 1995; Kayaalp 1997). Across a selection of the available literature the p.Phe39Leu variant has been reported in a compound heterozygous state in at least seven patients and in at least 101 of 1738 patient alleles where zygosity was not specified (Forrest et al. 1991; Guldberg et al. 1993; Tyfield et al. 1995; Zschocke et al. 1995; O'Donnell et al. 2002; Erlandsen et al. 2004; ZurflÃ¼h et al 2008; Polak et al. 2013). The p.Phe39Leu variant is more common in Scottish and Northern Irish PKU populations, with a frequency of approximately 6% and 9.5% respectively (Tyfield et al., 1995; Zschocke et al., 1995). In vitro functional analysis by Waters et al. (1999 and 2000) revealed that the variant is associated with increased protein aggregation and accelerated proteolytic degradation compared to wild type, as well as partial conversion of normal oligomeric protein forms to higher molecular weight aggregates. The p.Phe39Leu variant was absent from at least 236 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00013 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The variant is generally described as a BH4-responsive variant (Erlandsen et al. 2004; ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008; Heintz et al. 2012). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Phe39Leu variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

607	Pathogenic	Oct 01, 2018	The c.1066-11G>A variant in PAH has been reported in > 76 PKU alleles (BH4 deficiency excluded). (PP4_Moderate; PMID: 23500595; PMID: 8990013). This variant has 0% enzyme activity (PS3; http://www.biopku.org/centralStore/biopku/PAH%20activity.pdf). This variant was detected in trans with multiple known pathogenic variants: p.R243Q, p.R243X, p.R261Q, p.R270K, p.I65T. (PM3_Strong; PMID: 23500595; PMID: 8990013). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that the c.1066-11G>A variant may impact the protein (PP3).

607	Pathogenic	Jan 03, 2017	Variant summary: The PAH c.1066-11G>A variant is an intronic variant predicted to affect normal splicing by 4/5 splice prediction tools. This variant was found in 33/121034 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0002727, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic PAH variant (0.0079057). This variant is a known pathogenic variant and is one of the most common pathogenic variants causing PKU. It activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA. Normal amounts of liver PAH protein is present in homozygous patients, but no catalytic activity can be detected (Dworniczak_1991). This loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11 (Dworniczak_1991). The patients who carried this variant in homozygous state were not responsive to BH4 challenge (Dobrowolski_2011). Several clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases have classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as Pathogenic.

607	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change falls in intron 10 of the PAH mRNA. It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the PAH protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs5030855, ExAC 0.04%). This variant has been reported both as homozygous or in combination with another PAH variant in multiple individuals affected with phenylketonuria (PKU), being one of the most prevalent PKU-related variants in Europe (PMID: 25596310, 23500595, 24296287, 23430547, 8990013, 1601425, 22330942). This variant is also known as p.Gln355_Tyr356insGlyLeuGln. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 607). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes an aberrant splicing in the mRNA resulting in the insertion of three new amino acids (p.Gln355_Tyr356insGlyLeuGln) and producing a protein with null or very low enzymatic activity (PMID: 1769645, 12655546, 25596310). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

Functional analysis revealed that c.1066-11 G>A is associated with 5% residual enzyme activity compared to wild type (Danecka et al., 2015). The c.1066-11 G>A variant activates a cryptic splice site in intron 10 and causes abnormal gene splicing (Dworniczak et al., 1991). The responsiveness of the c.1066-11 G>A variant to BH4 therapy is not clear (Zurfluh et al., 2008; AldÃ¡miz-EchevarrÃ­a et al., 2016). In summary, we interpret c.1066-11 G>A as pathogenic.

608	Pathogenic	Dec 23, 2019	This sequence change replaces leucine with serine at codon 48 of the PAH protein (p.Leu48Ser). The leucine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between leucine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs5030841, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been reported in multiple individuals affected with classical and variant phenylketonuria (PKU) both in the homozygous and in the compound heterozygote state, and it is a well recognized PKU variant in Europe (PMID: 9399896, 1679030, 23430547, 23500595, 23430547). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 608). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes low PAH enzymatic activity (PMID: 11461190, 25596310, 23500595).

An individual homozygous for theR261X variant was reported to have classic phenylketonuria (PKU) (Couce et al., 2013). Functionalanalysis found that R261X is associated with significantly reduced enzyme activity (Zurfluh et al.,2008; Ho et al., 2013). The R261X variant is classified as not responsive to tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4) therapy (Zurfluh et al., 2008).

The variant allele was found at a frequency of 2.2e-05 in 277050 control chromosomes. c.781C>T has been reported in the literature in numerous individuals affected with Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity (Zurfluh_2008). Three clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. All laboratories classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

611	Pathogenic	Nov 03, 2016	Variant summary: The c.165delT (p.Phe55Leufs) variant in PAH gene is a frameshift change that results in the loss of the 393 amino acids of PAH (~85%). This change is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. According to the PAH enzymatic activity prediction it is expected to have a residual activity of 0%, which then will lead to elevated level of plasma Phe concentration. These predictions are in line with biochemical data observed in pts homozygous for c.165delT and presented with Classical PKU phenotype (MR, aphasia, elevated Phe plasma level ranging from 1477-2844umol/l). The variant is present in the large control population dataset of ExAC at a low frequency 0.000016 (2/121380 chrs tested). This frequency does not exceed the maximal expected frequency of a pathogenic allele (0.0079) in this gene. The variant has been reported in multiple affected individuals homozygously or in compound heterozygosity via published reports and has been cited as Pathogenic by several reputable databases/clinical laboratories.

611	Pathogenic	Jan 18, 2019	The c.165delT variant has been reported multiple times in various populations in association with a classic phenylketonuria (PKU) phenotype (Eigel et al. 1991; Alibakhshi et al. 2014; Groselj et al. 2012; Georgiou et al. 2012; Jeannesson-Thivisol et al. 2015; Sterl et al. 2013). It is unclear whether or not the c.165delT variant is responsive to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) therapy (Zurfluh et al. 2008). The c.165delT variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The c.165delT deletion causes a frameshift starting with codon Phenylalanine 55, changes this amino acid to a Leucine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 6 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Phe55LeufsX6. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In summary, we interpret c.165delT as pathogenic.

In support of this, there are other variants at the 408 codon that have been reported in patients with PKU (R408L, R408W), suggesting the codon is important for function. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

612	Pathogenic	Dec 02, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with glutamine at codon 408 of the PAH protein (p.Arg408Gln). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant is present in population databases (rs5030859, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed as homozygous or on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from other pathogenic variants in several individuals affected with PAH-related disease (PMID: 1312992, 24401910, 29317692, 10471838). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 612). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change reduces PAH protein stability (PMID: 12655546). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Variants that disrupt the p.Arg408 amino acid residue in PAH have been observed in affected individuals (PMID: 12173030, 2014036, 24401910). This suggests that it is a clinically significant residue, and that other variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

The phenylalanine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between phenylalanine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs62642933, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported as homozygous or in combination with other pathogenic PAH variants in several individuals affected with hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria. This variant has been described as a common cause of the disease in Norway and the British Islands, although it has also been observed in other populations (PMID: 7726156, 8831077, 9012412, 9781015, 12173030, 1312992, 26666653).

613	Pathogenic	Aug 14, 2018	The PAH c.896T>G (p.Phe299Cys) missense variant has been reported in at least six studies and identified in 12 individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) or hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) including in one individual with the variant in a homozygous state and 11 individuals in a compound heterozygous state (Eiken et al. 1992; Waters et al. 1998; Aulehla-Scholz and Heilbronner 2003). The variant was also identified in ten alleles where zygosity was not specified in individuals with classical PKU or HPA (Zschoke et al. 1995; KozÃ¡k et al. 1997). Control data are unavailable for the p.Phe299Cys variant which is reported at a frequency of 0.000349 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Carter et al. (1998) also report the variant at an average frequency of 6.4% in newborns with PKU or non-PKU HPA identified through newborn screening in Quebec. Based on the evidence, the p.Phe299Cys variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.

614	Pathogenic	Nov 30, 2019	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 7 of the PAH gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with phenylketonuria (PMID: 26322415, 27264808). This variant is also known as IVS7+2T>A in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 614). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in PAH are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 1301187, 9634518).

615	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	Across a selection of the available literature, the PAH c.1045T>C (p.Ser349Pro) missense variant has been identified in a total of 41 individuals with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, including in a homozygous state in four patients, in a compound heterozygous state in 39 patients, and in a heterozygous state in one patient (Forrest et al. 1991; John et al. 1992; Weinstein et al. 1993; Knappskog et al. 1995; Romano et al. 1996; Vela-Amieva et al. 2015; AldÃ¡miz-EchevarrÃ­a et al. 2016). The variant was also identified in an additional eight alleles of unknown zygosity (ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008; Couce et al. 2013). The p.Ser349Pro variant was absent from 152 control individuals but is reported at an allele frequency of 0.00005 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The p.Ser349Pro variant is associated with a severe phenotype and results in significantly reduced PAH activity levels of between 0% and 1.2%, and immunoreactivity levels of between 0% and 2.0% compared to wild type (Forrest et al. 1991; Weinstein et al. 1993; Knappskog et al. 1995; Romano et al. 1996). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ser349Pro variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.

615	Pathogenic	Jan 10, 2019	The S349P variant in the PAH gene has been reported as a pathogenic variant in the PAH Consortium database. The S349P missense variant is classified as a severe PAH pathogenic variant associated with a classic phenylketonuria (PKU) phenotype when homozygous or compound heterozygous with another severe PAH variant (Knappskog et al. 1995; Pey et al. 2007; RÃ©blovÃ¡ et al. 2015; Jeannesson-Thivisol et al. 2015). Functional studies found that S349P is associated with null to very little residual enzyme activity (Knappskog et al. 1995; Pey et al. 2007; Couce et al. 2013). Furthermore, S349 is a buried residue located in the catalytic site of the phenylalanine hydroxylase protein (RÃ©blovÃ¡ et al. 2015). The S349P variant is not responsive to BH4 therapy (Zurfluh et al., 2008).

615	Pathogenic	Sep 13, 2019	This sequence change replaces serine with proline at codon 349 of the PAH protein (p.Ser349Pro). The serine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between serine and proline. This variant is present in population databases (rs62508646, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been reported in individuals affected with mild or classic phenylketonuria, atypical phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia (PMID: 7860062, 8268925, 8659548, 9399896, 9781015, 10479481, 17096675, 17935162, 18294361, 2063869, 23500595, 23514811). Some individuals reported with phenylketonuria were homozygous for this variant. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 615). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change reduced the relative residual enzyme activity to 0-2% compared to wide type (PMID: 7860062, 8095248, 23500595, 17935162). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Ser349Ala) has been determined to be pathogenic and has been reported in individuals affected with phenylketonuria (PMID: 16256386, 26666653, 24705691). The Ser349 codon is located in the active site of the PAH protein and this residue contains a chemical group that is important for intramolecular contacts within the enzyme's active site (PMID: 26666653). This suggests that the serine residue is critical for PAH protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

622	Pathogenic	Jul 07, 2019	The c.3G>A (p.Met1Ile) variant is a null variant (start loss) where LOF is a known mechanism of disease. There are no known alternative start codons in other transcripts. The next in-frame Met is at amino acid 180 in exon 6. There are 49 pathogenic variants in ClinVar upstream of aa 180. The p.Met1Val variant has <3% enzyme activity as compared to wild type (PMID: 9450897), confirming start loss variants lead to loss of function of the PAH enzyme without re-initiation. This variant has been detected in multiple patients with PKU, BH4 deficiency excluded. PMID: 1301947, 23514811 (PP4_Moderate). This variant is absent in population databases (PM2). This variant was detected in trans with pathogenic variants IVS12+1G>A (PMID: 1301947) and p.F55L (27121329) (PM3_Strong). This variant has been detected de novo (PS2_moderate; PMID: 1301947), and in affected siblings (PP1; 23514811) In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.

623	Pathogenic	Dec 18, 2018	Across a selection of the available literature, the PAH c.1066-3C>T splice region variant has been reported in at least six studies in which it is found in a total of 15 probands including one in a homozygous state and 14 in a compound heterozygous state (Abadie et al. 1993; Dobrowolski et al. 2009; Heintz et al. 2012; Sterl et al. 2013; Ho et al. 2014; Jeannesson-Thivisol et al. 2015). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00019 in the European (Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Liver biopsy from a compound heterozygous proband found 1.5% of normal PAH activity (Abadie et al. 1993). RT-PCR of proband derived lymphoblast cells indicated exon 11 skipping and COS-1 cells transfected with minigenes confirmed c.1066-3C>T as the cause of exon 11 skipping (Heintz et al. 2012). Based on the evidence, the c.1066-3C>T variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

623	Pathogenic	Nov 08, 2019	This sequence change falls in intron 10 of the PAH gene. It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the PAH protein, but it affects a nucleotide within the consensus splice site of the intron. This variant is present in population databases (rs62507344, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been observed as homozygous in individuals affected with mild hyperphenylalaninemia or in combination with other pathogenic variants in several individuals affected with mild hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria (PMID: 8098245, 17502162, 19444284, 22526846, 22698810, 23357515 , 24368688, 26666653). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 623). Nucleotide substitutions within the consensus splice site are a relatively common cause of aberrant splicing (PMID: 17576681, 9536098). Experimental studies have shown that this intronic change leads to the out-of-frame skipping of exon 11 (PMID: 8098245, 22698810). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant was found in 12/121202 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.000099, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic PAH variant (0.0079057). This variant is widely described as one of the frequent pathogenic variants that causes hyperphenylalaninemia with consistent genotype-phenotype data and functional studies. Eight homozygotes with this variant were responsive to BH4 (Dobrowolski_2011) which can be attributed to mild functional effect of this variant.

The variant was also identified in 23/630 alleles of individuals with BH4-responsive mild hyperhpenylalaninemila (Guldberg et al. 1994; ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008; Couce et al. 2013; Trunzo et al. 2013). The p.Glu390Gly variant was absent from 110 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00018 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Averaged across different cell systems, the p.Glu390Gly variant showed 72.7% residual enzyme activity (ZurflÃ¼h et al. 2008), while expression in COS-7 cells revealed that the p.[Glu390Gly];[Arg408Trp] genotype, a recurrent genotype in European and Middle Eastern populations, showed 8.3% residual activity compared to wild type (Danecka et al. 2015). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Glu390Gly variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.

628	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The PAH c.1139C>T (p.Thr380Met) missense variant has been reported in at least 14 studies in which it is found in a total of 24 patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency including in 19 in a compound heterozygous state, and five in a heterozygous state (Guldberg et al. 1993; Zschocke et al. 1994; Zschocke et al. 1995; Kayaalp et al. 1997; Zekanowski et al. 1997; PÃ©rez et al. 1997; Tyfield et al. 1997; Guldberg et al. 1998; Yang et al. 2001; Ho et al. 2014; Liu et al 2015). The p.Thr380Met variant was found in 1.2 - 5% of alleles tested in subsequent studies of PAH deficiency (Desviat et al. 1999; Bercovich et al. 2008; Okano et al. 2011). Control data are unavailable for this variant from these studies, which is reported at a frequency of 0.0007 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. In functional studies by Heintz et al. (2012), the p.Thr380Met variant enzyme was shown to have a reduced activity of 38% compared to the wild type. This residual activity is consistent with the milder phenotype associated with this variant. The variant created a new exonic splice enhancer resulting in a stronger definition of exon 11 of the PAH gene, having a positive effect on splicing and the inclusion of exon 11. RNA affinity binding and Western blotting analysis showed that the p.Thr380Met variant abolished the normal binding of three splicing factors seen in the wild type. When found with a severe PAH variant, the p.Thr380Met variant is thought be involved in mild elevations of serum phenylalanine. These patients do not require dietary treatment. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Thr380Met variant is classified as pathogenic for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

628	Pathogenic	Dec 19, 2019	This sequence change replaces threonine with methionine at codon 380 of the PAH protein (p.Thr380Met). The threonine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between threonine and methionine. This variant is present in population databases (rs62642937, ExAC 0.05%). This variant has been reported in the literature in the homozygous and in the heterozygous state in multiple individuals affected with mild phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (PMID: 8268925, 23500595, 18299955, 14722928, 26666653, 10598814, 26600521, 9429153, 8533759, Invitae). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 628). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts PAH protein function decreasing the residual enzymatic activity to 28-38% of wild-type in vitro (PMID: 22698810, 27620137). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

628	Pathogenic	Oct 12, 2018	A heterozygous missense variant, NM_000277.1(PAH):c.1139C>T, has been identified in exon 11 of 13 of the PAH gene. The variant is predicted to result in a moderate amino acid change from a threonine to a methionine at position 380 of the protein, NP_000268.1(PAH):p.(Thr380Met). The threonine residue at this position has high conservation (100 vertebrates, UCSC), and is located within the biopterin domain. In silico predictions for this variant are consistently pathogenic (Polyphen, SIFT, CADD, Mutation Taster). The variant is present in the gnomAD database at a frequency of 0.04% (108 heterozygotes, 1 homozygote). The variant has previously been described multiple times as pathogenic in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (ClinVar). Additionally, patients with this variants were shown to have a reduced enzyme activity of 38% (Heintz, C., et al. (2012)). Analysis of parental samples indicated this variant was paternally inherited and to be present in cis with the second reported PAH variant. Based on the information available at the time of curation, this variant has been classified as PATHOGENIC.

628	Pathogenic	Jun 21, 2016	Variant summary: The PAH c.1139C>T (p.Thr380Met) variant causes a missense change involving a conserved nucleotide and 5/5 in silico tools predicting a "damaging" outcome. This variant lies on active site of catalytic domain, therefore it is expected to alter catalysis. The variant of interest was found in the large and broad control populations from ExAC with an allele frequency of 1/3032 (0.00032; 40/121272 chromosomes), which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic PAH variant of 1/126 (0.0079057). The variant of interest has been widely reported as a pathogenic mutation that causes mild HPA in the literature. It was found in several affected individuals with mild hyperphenylalaninemia, some patients known to be compound heterozygous with other pathogenic/potentially pathogenic variants. A functional study shows that the variant leads to impaired enzymatic activity consistent with the mild phenotype seen in patients carrying this variant. In addition, multiple reputable clinical laboratories/databases classify the variant as "pathogenic." Taken together, the variant of interest is classified as Pathogenic.

628	Likely pathogenic	Dec 20, 2019	NM_000277.1(PAH):c.1139C>T(T380M) is classified as likely pathogenic in the context of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Sources cited for classification include the following: PMID 27620137, 22698810, 8830172, 10598814, 17096675, 23792259, 9012412, 10394930, 26666653, 27243974, 8533759, 26542770, 23357515, 12655553, 16198137, 9298832, 27121329, 14722928, 18294361, 18299955, 23500595, 8268925, 21307867, 9634518, 23932990, 10693064, 16198137, 8533759, 11385716, 22698810, 24350308, 17924342, 21147011 and 24368688. Classification of NM_000277.1(PAH):c.1139C>T(T380M) is based on the following criteria: This variant has been observed more frequently in patients with clinical diagnoses than in healthy populations.

629	Pathogenic	Dec 22, 2019	The PAH variant c.136G>A (p.Gly46Ser) was detected in four alleles associated with moderate PKU (phenylalanine values of 900-1200 micromol/L). Patients included in the study had serum phenylalanine levels above 150 micromol/L and normal urinary excretion of biopterin and neopterin (PMID: 7556322). The variant c.136G>A (p.Gly46Ser) was documented in trans with seven other PAH pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 15 Norwegian patients with mild and classic PKU. Haplotype analysis of index cases and parents was conducted, when necessary siblings were also investigated (PMID: 8829656). PM3_Very Strong (14 points). In vitro, enzyme activity assays demonstrated a residual activity for the PAH variant c.136G>A (p.Gly46Ser) between 26% and 38% compared to the wild type PAH when using the mammalian cell-free transcription-translation system (PMID: 11161839). According to gnomAD, this variant is present at a low allele frequency in population databases, with the highest reported frequency in the European (Non-Finnish) population (0.00015). In silico modeling, predictions are conflicting. According to SIFT this variant is predicted to be tolerated, probably damaging by Polyphen 2-HVAR and disease-causing Automatic by Mutation Taster. In summary, this variant meets the criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH. PAH-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PM2, PM3_Very Strong, PP4 met_moderate, and PS3.

629	Pathogenic	Jul 09, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with serine at codon 46 of the PAH protein (p.Gly46Ser). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glycine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs74603784, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported in multiple individuals affected with PAH-related disease (PMID: 23500595, 7556322, 26210745) and associated with both mild and classic PKU phenotypes (PMID: 9634518, 23500595). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 629). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change impairs the function of the encoded protein in vitro (PMID: 20937381, 8829656, 21953985, 11326337, 23500595, 28174686).

629	Pathogenic	Nov 19, 2018	Variant summary: PAH c.136G>A (p.Gly46Ser) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the ACT domain (IPR002912) of the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 7.6e-05 in 277146 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in PAH causing Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (Phenylketonuria) (7.6e-05 vs 0.0079), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.136G>A has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency (e.g. Bueno_2013, Eiken_1996). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. Publications also reported experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The variant effect resulted in a smaller than 30% of normal activity (Bueno_2013, Eiken_1996). One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

631	Pathogenic	Nov 06, 2015	The R167H variant in the PAH gene has been reported as a pathogenic variant in the PAH Consortium database. The R176L pathogenic variant is considered a mild PAH variant as it is associated with significant residual phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity and has been described in association with mild and moderate phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (Zurfluh et al., 2008; Couce et al., 2013; Guldberg et al., 1994). R176L is reported to be a tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive variant (Zurfluh et al., 2008). Therefore, we interpret R167H in PAH as a pathogenic variant.

636	Pathogenic	Nov 02, 2018	The I65T missense variant has most often been reported in association with mild phenylketonuria (PKU) phenotype and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) responsiveness (Pey et al., 2007; Zurfluh et al, 2008). However, it has also been identified in a number of patients with moderate or classic PKU, and in a BH4 unresponsive patient with a classic PKU phenotype (Couce et al., 2013). The I65T variant is located in the regulatory domain of the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme and has been associated with 27% to 60% residual phenylalanine hydroxylase activity (Couce et al., 2013). In summary, we interpret I65T as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000239044.9	PAH	-

The glutamic acid residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glutamic acid and glycine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from another pathogenic variant in an individual affected with PKU (Invitae). In addition, this variant has been reported in combination with another PAH variant in individuals affected withÂ¬â€ hyperphenylalaninemiaÂ¬â€ or mild hyperphenylalaninemiaÂ¬â€ (PMID: 12655546, 24401910, 11935335).Â¬â€ This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 639). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change has mild impact on enzyme activity and protein stability (PMID:Â¬â€ 17935162, 21953985). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies.

642	Pathogenic	Oct 13, 2017	This c.1601G>A (p.Arg534Gln) variant is known as the Factor V Leiden variant (legacy name p.Arg506Gln). Factor V Leiden variant is associated with thrombophilia due to activated protein C resistance [MIM:188055]. Studies suggest that the relative risk for venous thrombosis associated with the factor V Leiden variant in the absence of other acquired or environmental predispositions is approximately 4- to 7-fold for heterozygotes and 80-fold for homozygotes (PMID 16024978). This variant is classified as pathogenic. Homozygosity for this variant is also considered medically actionable.

642	risk factor	Jan 07, 2016	The p.Arg534Gln variant (previously known as p.Arg506Gln) in F5 is commonly referred to as "factor V Leiden" and has been associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) with an overall odds ratio (OR) of 4.3 (Simone 2013). The frequency of this variant varies by population, with the highest heterozygosity rate found in Europe. It has been identified in 3.1% (2085/66714) of European chromosomes and 0.4% (46/10404) of African chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs6025). The factor V Leiden variant is present in approximately 15-20% of individuals with a first deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in up to 50% of individual with recurrent VTE or an estrogen-related thrombosis. Many individuals with the factor V Leiden allele never develop thrombosis, however, evidence suggests that the relative risk for VTE is increased 3- to 8-fold in factor V Leiden heterozygotes and 10- to 80-fold in homozygotes. Lastly, heterozygosity for factor V Leiden is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in relative risk for pregnancy loss, and possibly other pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, fetal growth retardation, and placental abruption.

642	Pathogenic	Jan 09, 2020	This sequence change replaces arginine with glutamine at codon 534 of the F5 protein (p.Arg534Gln). The arginine residue is weakly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant, also known as the Factor V Leiden mutation, is a well documented and common cause of activated protein C resistance (PMID: 8164741, 7910348). This variant has also been reported as R506Q. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 642). This variant disrupts the activated protein C cleavage site in the F5 protein and leads to a defective anticoagulant response in vitro (PMID: 7911872, 7910348). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

642	Pathogenic	Mar 30, 2016	The c.1601G>A (p.Arg534Gln) missense variant is a common disease-causing variant in the F5 gene. This missense variant destroys one of three APC cleavage sites in factor V, rendering the protein resistant to APC inactivation. Arg534Gln heterozygotes and homozygotes have an increased risk for Factor V Thrombophilia; however, clinical expression is variable and most individuals never develop thrombosis (GeneReviews: Kujovich et al., 2010, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1368/). Therefore, this collective evidence supports the classification of the c.1601G>A (p.Arg534Gln) as a Pathogenic variant for Factor V Thrombophilia.

649	Pathogenic	Jan 11, 2019	The F5 c.5189A>G (p.Tyr1730Cys) missense variant, also referred to as p.Tyr1702Cys in the literature, has been reported in four studies in which it is found in a total of seven individuals with factor V deficiency and FV:C levels <1-2%, including in four in a homozygous state, in two in a compound heterozygous state, and in one in a heterozygous state in whom a second variant was not identified (Castoldi et al. 2001; Montefusco et al. 2003; Yamakage et al. 2006; Talbot et al. 2010). Two of the homozygous individuals remained asymptomatic. The p.Tyr1730Cys variant is also found in three symptomatic individuals with FV:C levels of between 30-60%, including one individual with digenic variants (Castoldi et al. 2000; Castoldi et al. 2001). The p.Tyr1730Cys variant was reported in one of 200 control individuals who showed reduced FV levels (FV:c 58%). This variant is reported at a frequency of 0.000036 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Castoldi et al. (2000) noted a lack of expression of the p.Tyr1730Cys variant protein in the plasma of an affected individual while FV activity in plasma of carriers was reported at 65% (Yamakage et al. 2006). Additionally, functional studies in COS-1 cells demonstrate significantly impaired secretion and inadequate FV procoagulant activity of mutant protein as compared to the wildtype protein (Yamakage et al. 2006). The Tyr1730 residue is highly conserved and X-ray crystal structure analysis suggest that this residue may play an important role in maintaining the structure and function of the FV molecule. Based on the collective evidence the p.Tyr1730Cys variant is classified as pathogenic for factor V deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

659	Pathogenic	May 18, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with tryptophan at codon 211 of the PROC protein (p.Arg211Trp). The arginine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and tryptophan. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918143, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous orÂ¬â€ compound heterozygous in individuals affected withÂ¬â€ purpura fulminans andÂ¬â€ severe protein C deficiencyÂ¬â€ (PMID:Â¬â€ 10942114, 28111891), as heterozygous in individuals with venous thromboembolism and partial protein C deficiency (PMID:Â¬â€ 3185623, 18954896,Â¬â€ 24162787,Â¬â€ 10805275), and has been shown toÂ¬â€ segregate with disease in several families (PMID:Â¬â€ 8165644,Â¬â€ 10942114,Â¬â€ 18573519). This variant is also known asÂ¬â€ Arg157Trp orÂ¬â€ Arg169TrpÂ¬â€ in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 659). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

661	Uncertain significance	Nov 15, 2018	The PROC c.629C>T (p.Pro210Leu) missense variant has been reported in four studies and is found in a total of 12 individuals with protein C deficiency including two in a homozygous state, one in a compound heterozygous state, and at least nine in a heterozygous state (Conard et al. 1992; Reitsma et al. 1995; David et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2014). One homozygous patient had at least six unaffected family members who carried the variant in a heterozygous state (Conard et al. 1992). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00002 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium, but this is based on one allele only so the variant is presumed to be rare. Based on the evidence, the p.Pro210Leu variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious of pathogenicity for protein C deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

680	Likely pathogenic	Mar 09, 2017	This sequence change replaces serine with leucine at codon 312 of the PROC protein (p.Ser312Leu). The serine residue is moderately conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between serine and leucine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918160, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been reported in individuals with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and protein C (PC) deficiency (PMID: 7482420, 22545135). It has also been reported to arise de novo in a proband with DVT, PE, and PC deficiency, whose children inherited this variant and also had low levels of plasma protein C and protein C activity (PMID: 11380450). However, the proband's mother, who did not carry this variant, also had a history of PE. This variant is also known as 8524C>T, p.Ser270Leu in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 680). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes defective secretion of protein C (PMID: 11380450). In summary, this variant is a rare missense change that has been observed in affected individuals and shown to disrupt protein function. This evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data is needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

691	Benign	May 02, 2017	Variant summary: The FUCA1 c.857A>G (p.Gln286Arg) variant involves the alteration of a non-conserved nucleotide. 3/4 in silico tools predict a benign outcome for this variant, however experimental findings confirmed, that Q289R retained its functional activity. This variant was found in 33884/121394 control chromosomes (5299 homozygotes) at a frequency of 0.2791242, which is approximately 250 times the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic FUCA1 variant (0.001118), strong evidence that this variant is a benign polymorphism. The variant has been reported in the literature in affected individuals who also carry known pathogenic FUCA1 variants, and has been shown to be present in the homozygous state in numerous unaffected relatives, indicating the variant does not segregate with disease. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as benign. Taken together, this variant is classified as benign.

700	Pathogenic	Feb 12, 2018	The R386C missense variant in the GALNS gene has been reported previously in association with ucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA). Patients homozygous for R386C are reported to have a severe MPS IVA phenotype (Tomatsu et al., 1997). This variant is located within the active site of the N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase enzyme (Rivera-Colon et al., 2012). R386C is the most prevalent GALNS variant having been reported on 8.9% of mutant alleles (Tomatsu et al., 2005).

700	Pathogenic	Dec 04, 2017	Variant summary: The GALNS c.1156C>T (p.Arg386Cys) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide and 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant (SNPsandGO not captured due to low reliability index). A functional study, Fukuda_1996, supports these predictions with the observation that the variant causes deficient GALNS activity. This variant was found in 23/275538 control chromosomes (gnomAD) at a frequency of 0.0000835, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic GALNS variant (0.0020412). Multiple publications have cited the variant in affected homozygous and compound heterozygous pts. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

700	Pathogenic	Jun 01, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 386 of the GALNS protein (p.Arg386Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs118204437, ExAC 0.05%). This variant has been reported in several individuals affected with Morquio syndrome both in the homozygous state or in combination with other GALNS variants (PMID: 7795586, 26147980, 9298823, 23227063, 22976768, 24726177). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 700). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change abrogates GALNS enzymatic activity (PMID: 7795586, 15309681). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg386Ser) has been reported as a compound heterozygous in an individual affected with Morquio syndrome (PMID: 25252036). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

703	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The GALNS c.337A>T (p.Ile113Phe) missense variant is described as the second most frequently reported pathogenic variant, accounting for five percent of mucopolysaccharidosis type IV type A patient alleles (Morrone et al. 2014), and is especially common among patients of British and Irish descent. Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Ile113Phe variant has been identified in a homozygous state in two patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IV, in a compound heterozygous state in 11 patients, and in a heterozygous state in six patients (Tomatsu et al. 1995; Yamada et al. 1998; Tomatsu et al. 2004; Dung et al. 2013; Bhattacharya et al. 2014). The p.Ile113Phe variant was absent from 300 control chromosomes (Tomatsu et al. 1995; Yamada et al. 1998; Tomatsu et al. 2004) and is reported at a frequency of 0.00012 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project; however, this frequency is based on one allele only in a region of good sequence coverage, suggesting the variant is rare. In vitro transient expression studies showed that the p.Ile113Phe variant reduced cDNA expression to approximately five percent of wild type (Tomatsu et al. 1995; Sukegawa et al. 2000). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ile113Phe variant is classified as pathogenic for mucopolysaccharidosis type IV. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

703	Pathogenic	Jul 03, 2019	Variant summary: GALNS c.337A>T (p.Ile113Phe) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Sulfatase, N-terminal domain (IPR000917) of the encoded protein sequence. Three of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4e-05 in 250984 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in GALNS causing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (Morquio Syndrome A) (4e-05 vs 0.002), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.337A>T has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (Morquio Syndrome A) (Yamada_1998, Tomatsu_2004, Dung_2013). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. Several publications report experimental evidence evaluating the effects of the variant on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity (Yamada_1998, Sukegawa_2000). Two ClinVar submissions (evaluation after 2014) cite the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

729	Pathogenic	Jun 16, 2015	The S45F variant in the UQCRQ gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state inassociation with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (Barel et al., 2008). The S45F substitution was notobserved at any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and AfricanAmerican ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variantin these populations. The S45F variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution that is not conservedacross species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the proteinstructure/function. We interpret S45F as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000517438.4	UQCRQ	-

734	Pathogenic	Jul 25, 2016	Variant summary: The TMEM43 c.1073C>T (p.Ser358Leu) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide and is located in third transmembrane domain of the protein (Christensen_2011). 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant. Functional studies have shown that the S358L mutant reduces conduction velocity, increases the stiffness cell nuclei and alters the gap junction function (Siragam_PLoS One_2014 and Milting_Eur Heart J_2015). This variant was absent in 123942 control chromosomes. This variant has been widely reported as a founder mutation in Newfoundland. From a study of 15 families from Newfoundland, median age to develop an ARVD associated phenotype was 32 years for males and 44 years for females, with 100% of males and females penetrant by 63 and 76 years, respectively (Milting_Eur Heart J_2015). Haplotype analysis revealed an estimated age of 13001500 years for the mutation, which proves the European origin of the Newfoundland mutation (Milting_Eur Heart J_2015). Interestingly, this variant was also found as a confirmed de novo variant in an ARVC patient from New Zealand. Haplotype analysis revealed that the mutation occurred on a different haplotype in the patient than in the patients from Newfoundland (Baskin_HG_2013). Multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as Pathogenic.

734	Pathogenic	Nov 29, 2019	This sequence change replaces serine with leucine at codon 358 of the TMEM43 protein (p.Ser358Leu). The serine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between serine and leucine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to be a founder variant for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in the region of Newfoundland (Canada), although it has been described in other populations (PMID: 18313022, 21214875, 22725725, 23810883, 24598986 ) It has also been reported to be de novo in one ARVC individual (PMID: 23812740). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 734). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change affects localization of proteins involved in conduction and alters gap junction function during transient expression assays in cardiomyocyte cultures (PMID: 25343256). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

734	Pathogenic	Aug 05, 2018	The Ser358Leu mutation in the TMEM43 gene has been reported in association with ARVC (McNally E et al., 2009). In the Newfoundland population, Merner N et al. identified a founder mutation, Ser358Leu, in the TMEM43 gene, and classified the disorder as autosomal dominant arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 (Merner N et al., 2008; McNally E et al., 2009). Based on a study of 83 individuals with ARVC5, the Ser358Leu mutation appears to be fully penetrant and associated with a severe phenotype.

734	Pathogenic	Dec 03, 2010	Note this variant was found in clinical genetic testing performed by one or more labs who may also submit to ClinVar. Thus any internal case data may overlap with the internal case data of other labs. The interpretation reviewed below is that of the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease. This variant was found in a large kindred in Newfoundland (Merner et al 2008) with strong segregation data supporting it's pathogenicity. In that study the variant was not observed in 208 control individuals. In silico analysis with Polyphen-2 predicts the variant to be probably damaging. The Serene at codon 358 is completely conserved across species. Merner et al reported that in their kindred of 257 affected individuals there was age-dependent but complete penetrance with a severe phenotype. The phenotype was modified by gender, with a median life expectancy of 41 years in males and 71 years in females. Heart failure was a late manifestation.

743	Uncertain significance	Dec 03, 2018	The homozygous p.Pro1122Ser variant in CC2D2A was identified by our study in one individual with Joubert syndrome. The p.Pro1122Ser variant in CC2D2A has been reported in at least 5 Saudi Arabian individuals with Joubert syndrome (PMID: 26092869, 18950740), and has been identified in 0.01951% (1/5126) of other chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, although there is some suspicion of pathogenicity, the clinical significance of the p.Pro1122Ser variant is uncertain. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM2, PP3, PM1_Supporting (Richards 2015).

744	Likely pathogenic	Mar 29, 2018	A likely pathogenic variant has been identified in the CC2D2A gene. The R1528C variant has been reported previously in trans with the c.3774dupT variant in an individual with JSRD (Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2015). Additionally, R1528C has been observed in trans with other CC2D2A variants (c.3289delG; c.3772-1G>T) and in the homozygous state in association with COACH syndrome and JSRD (Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2015; Gorden et al., 2008). Different missense variants at the same codon (R1528H) and in a nearby residue (T1526N) have also been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with Joubert syndrome (Ben-Salem et al., 2014; Stenson et al., 2014). The R1528C variant was not observed in approximately 6,100 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This substitution occurs at a position where amino acids with similar properties to Arginine are tolerated across species; however, the R1528C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Additionally, in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore, the R1528C variant is likely pathogenic; however, the possibility that it is benign cannot be excluded.

759	Pathogenic	May 31, 2018	The R570X variant in the TRAPPC9 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in a consanguineous Tunisian family of three siblings with autosomal recessive microcephaly and intellectual disability (Philippe et al., 2009). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and in vitro studies revealed undetectable levels of TRAPPC9 protein in skin fibroblasts from a patient with the homozygous R570X variant (Philippe et al., 2009). The R570X variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret R570X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329560.6	TRAPPC9	-

767	Pathogenic	Nov 21, 2019	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the MMADHC gene (p.Arg250*). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 47 amino acids of the MMADHC protein. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with cobalamin D deficiency (PMID: 18385497, 27252276, 28939051, 29620684).

786	Pathogenic	Jun 30, 2017	The Ala280Val variant in the GPD1L gene has been reported in one large, multigeneration family with multiple individuals with Brugada syndrome (London B et al., 2007). The Ala280Val variant co-segregated with a Brugada syndrome phenotype in 16 relatives, but was also identified in 27 asymptomatic relatives in the two youngest generations of the pedigree (London B et al., 2007). Functional studies suggested that the Ala280Val variant in GDP1L interferes with the trafficking of cardiac SCN5A sodium channels to the plasma membrane and reduces inward sodium current (London B et al., 2007; Valdivia C et al., 2009). While the 1000 Genomes database reports Ala280Val in 2/762 alleles (0.3%) from individuals of European ancestry (Kersey P et al., 2010), published controls studies did not identify Ala280Val in >1,000 control alleles (London B et al., 2007). Additionally, Ala280Val was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.

786	Uncertain significance	Dec 06, 2019	This sequence change replaces alanine with valine at codon 280 of the GPD1L protein (p.Ala280Val). The alanine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between alanine and valine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72552291, ExAC 0.01%), and has an allele count higher than expected for a pathogenic variant (PMID: 28166811). This variant has been reported to segregate with Brugada syndrome in a multigenerational family (PMID: 17967977). It has also been reported in an independent individual affected with Brugada syndrome and in an individual that suffered sudden death by unknown cause (PMID: 26743238, 27435932). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 786). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change reduces sodium channel current and trafficking, which affects surface membrane protein density and the number of functional channels (PMID: 17967977, 19666841, 19745168, 20724705). For these reasons, this allele has been classified as Uncertain Significance.

786	Uncertain significance	Nov 02, 2017	Variant classified as Uncertain Significance - Favor Pathogenic. The p.Ala280Val variant in GPD1L has been reported in 1 infant who died suddenly, 2 individuals with Brugada syndrome, and 1 individual with LVNC who also carried a likely pat hogenic variant in TTN (Weiss 2002, London 2007, Alder 2016, Methner 2016. Misza lski-Jamka 2017). It segregated with Brugada syndrome in 15 members of 1 family (London 2007), but was also identified in multiple individuals without clinical features of Brugada syndrome (London 2007, Dewey 2016). In vitro functional stud ies provide some evidence that the p.Ala280Val variant may impact protein functi on (London 2007, Liu 2009, Valdivia 2009); however, these types of assays may no t accurately represent biological function. Furthermore, this variant has also b een identified in 0.02% (25/126354) of European chromosomes by gnomAD (http://gn omad.broadinstitute.org). Additionally, the alanine (Ala) at position 280 is not conserved, with 3 mammals (opossum, Tasmanian devil, wallaby) and >25 evolution arily distant species carrying a valine (Val) at this position. These data raise the possibility that this change may be tolerated. In summary, while there is s ome suspicion for a pathogenic role based on segregation and functional studies, there is conflicting data for this variant and limited evidence supporting an a ssociation with GPD1L variants and Brugada syndrome. Therefore, the clinical sig nificance of the p.Ala280Val variant is uncertain.

787	Uncertain significance	Apr 03, 2017	The E83K variant of uncertain significance in the GPD1L gene has been reported previously in one male with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and was not identified in 600 reference alleles (Van Norstrand et al., 2007). The E83K variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Moreover, this substitution occurs at a position where only amino acids with similar properties to glutamic acid are tolerated across species. Functional studies demonstrated that the E83K variant exhibits significantly less enzymatic activity than wild-type GPD1L, resulting in reduction in sodium channel current (Van Norstrand et al., 2007; Valdivia et al., 2009). Nevertheless, E83K was observed in 19/66,736 (0.03%) alleles from individuals of European (Non-Finnish) ancestry in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (Lek et al., 2016).

787	Uncertain significance	Dec 11, 2019	This sequence change replaces glutamic acid with lysine at codon 83 of the GPD1L protein (p.Glu83Lys). The glutamic acid residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glutamic acid and lysine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72552292, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has not been reported in the literature in individuals with GPD1L-related disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 787). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change results in decreased enzymatic activity (PMID: 17967976, 19666841). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

788	Likely benign	Jul 25, 2018	Variant summary: GPD1L c.370A>G (p.Ile124Val) results in a conservative amino acid change located in the N-terminal of the Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD-dependent domain (IPR011128) of the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a benign effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.0029 in 277792 control chromosomes in the gnomAD database and publications, including 7 homozygotes. The observed variant frequency is approximately 289-fold of the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic variant in GPD1L causing Arrhythmia phenotype (1e-05), strongly suggesting that the variant is benign. The variant, c.370A>G, has been reported in the literature in individuals affected with SIDS, sudden death, and atrial fibrillation (VanNorstrand_2007, Skinner_2014, Husser_2017). These data do not allow any conclusion about variant significance. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function, however, does not allow convincing conclusions about the variant effect (VanNorstrand_2007). Four clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. All laboratories classified the variant as benign/likely benign. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as likely benign.

789	Uncertain significance	Jun 27, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 273 of the GPD1L protein (p.Arg273Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72552294, ExAC 0.008%). This variant has been observed in an individual affected with sudden infant death syndrome (PMID:Â¬â€ 17967976). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 789). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change reduces sodium current density (PMID:Â¬â€ 17967976). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

789	Uncertain significance	Sep 04, 2015	The R273C variant of unknown significance in the GPD1L gene has been reported previously in one case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and was absent in 600 control alleles (Van Norstrand et al., 2007). However, additional clinical and family history information on this case was not available due to the blinded nature of this study. Functional studies showed that GPD1L containing the R273C variant caused a significant reduction in sodium channel current when co-expressed with SCN5A in cultured cells (Van Norstrand et al., 2007), however, this assay does not reflect the heterozygous state in a human cardiomyocyte and may not accurately reflect the impact of this variant in vivo. The R273C mutation was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R273C mutation is a non-conservative change at a conserved residue. In silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function.Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000223480.13	GPD1L	-

797	Benign	Jun 05, 2017	Variant summary: The APC c.1240C>T (p.Arg414Cys) variant causes a missense change involving the alteration of a conserved nucleotide. 5/5 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant. However, a functional study found that this variant maintained inhibitory activity on the transcription mediated by the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex, as did wild-type APC. The variant of interest has been found in a large, broad control population, ExAC in 105/120892 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0008685, which is approximately 12 times the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic APC variant (0.0000714), suggesting this variant is likely a benign polymorphism. This variant was found in multiple studies in FAP patients (van der Klift_PMS2_Hum Mutat_2016, Azzopardi_CancerRsrch_2008) but one functional study and the high frequency in population suggests a benign effect. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases recently classified this variant as likely benign/benign. Taken together, this variant is classified as benign.

816	Pathogenic	Jan 09, 2012	The p.Glu1309fs variant in APC has been seen in over 100 individuals with famili al adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and is the most common pathogenic APC variant in patients with FAP (Aretz 2004, Friedl 2005, Plawski 2008, GeneReviews). It has b een shown to occur de novo and to segregate with disease in multiple families (A retz 2004). This variant has also been reported by other clinical laboratories i n ClinVar (Variation ID# 816). In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Glu1309fs variant may impact protein function (Dihlmann 2009). This variant has been identified in 2/111348 European chromosomes by the Genome Aggre gation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs80338757). Th is variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, which alters the protein?s amino acid sequence beginning at position 1309 and leads to a premature termination co don 4 amino acids downstream. This termination codon occurs within the last exon and is more likely to escape nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and result in a trun cated protein. Downstream nonsense and frameshift variants at the 3' end of the gene have been reported in individuals with APC and lead to a non-functional pro tein. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for FAP in an autosomal dominant manner based upon presence in multiple affected in dividuals, segregation studies, low frequency in the general population and de n ovo occurrence.

816	Pathogenic	Jan 06, 2020	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the APC gene (p.Glu1309Aspfs*4). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 1535 amino acids of the APC protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs763847228, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been reported in numerous individuals and families affected with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (PMID: 20223039, 1316610, 23159591, 24664542), and is the most frequently observed APC pathogenic variant in individuals with FAP (PMID: 20223039). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 816). Numerous pathogenic truncating variants have been reported downstream of this variant (PMID: 8940264, 11247896, 20434453), suggesting that deletion of this region of the APC protein is causative of disease.

816	Pathogenic	Oct 16, 2018	This deletion of five nucleotides in APC is denoted c.3927_3931delAAAGA at the cDNA level and p.Glu1309AspfsX4 (E1309DfsX4) at the protein level. The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is AAGA[delAAAGA]TTGG. The deletion causes a frameshift, which changes a Glutamic Acid to an Aspartic Acid at codon 1309 and creates a premature stop codon at position 4 of the new reading frame. It is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation as the last 1535 amino acids are lost and replaced with 3 incorrect amino acids. The disrupted region at the end of the gene includes the EB1 and hDLG binding domains and a portion of the basic domain (Azzopardi 2008). APC c.3927_3931delAAAGA is a common pathogenic variant that has been observed in numerous families with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (Miyoshi 1992, Aretz 2004, Friedl 2005, Papp 2015).

821	Pathogenic	Dec 11, 2017	Variant summary: The APC c.5582_5585delCTTT (p.Ser1861fsX1) variant results in a termination codon in the last exon, however deletes a large number of amino acids (i.e. deletes the last 981 amino acids). Truncations downstream of this position have been classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic by clinical laboratories in ClinVar (e.g. c.5952_5955delTG, c.5973delG, c.6053delC, etc.). This variant is absent in 245758 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This variant has been reported in a large Dutch family with attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis where it co-segregated with disease (van der Luijt_1996). Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected family members from this kindred showed only the wild-type APC protein, showing that it does not result into stable truncated APC protein. Multiple reputable databases have classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

822	Uncertain significance	Aug 27, 2019	Variant summary: APC c.3920T>A (p.Ile1307Lys) results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the encoded protein sequence. Three of five in-silico tools predict a benign effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.002 in 251040 control chromosomes in the gnomAD database (exomes dataset), predominantly found within the Ashkenazi Jewish subpopulation at a frequency of 0.036, including 7 homozygotes. The observed variant frequency within Ashkenazi Jewish control individuals in the gnomAD database is approximately 500 fold of the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic variant in APC causing Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) phenotype (7.1e-05), strongly suggesting that the variant is a benign polymorphism found primarily in populations of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The variant, c.3920T>A, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with colorectal cancer (CRC) and other tumor phenotypes, however in some of these cases it was also reported to co-occur with other pathogenic variants (Yurgelun_2017 and Simbolo_2015). Multiple case-control studies (Abdel-Malak_2016, Drucker_2000, Fidder_2005, Gryfe_1998, Laken_1997, Leshno_2016, and Shtoyerman-Chen_2001), demonstrated that this variant is associated with a moderately increased risk for CRC in Ashkenazi Jewish population. A large meta-analysis concluded that the variant increases the risk about two-fold for CRC in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.65-2.86), however it does not appear to confer an additional risk for CRC in non-Ashkenazi cases (Liang_2013). A recent case-control study involving a large Israeli cohort indicated that this variant might be also associated with a significantly higher risk for non-CRC cancers, with the APC I1307K variant being proposed as a reliable marker for overall cancer risk (OR=2.53) (Leshno_2016). The A8 mononucleotide tract created by this germline change has been shown to confer an increased propensity for generating somatic frameshift mutations on this allele, leading to a loss of function of APC that constitutes an important somatic event in tumor initiation (Gryfe_1998; Laken_1997). 19 other submitters have provided clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. Multiple laboratories reported the variant with conflicting assessments, with 7 reporting it as a risk factor. Taken together, this polymorphic variant is associated with a modestly increased risk for CRC in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is not associated with FAP or AFAP. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as VUS-possibly pathogenic.

822	Likely benign	Jun 20, 2018	The APC c.3920T>A; p.Ile1307Lys variant has been reported extensively in the literature. One recent meta-analysis of 30 published population studies, all of which examined the association between p.Ile1307Lys and colorectal neoplasia, colorectal adenoma, and/or colorectal cancer, concluded that this variant confers a two-fold increased risk of developing a colorectal neoplasia to persons of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (Liang 2013 and references therein). However, the c.3920T>A;p.Ile1307Lys variant is observed in the general population at an overall frequency of 0.18% (506/276756 alleles, 6 homozygotes) in the Genome Aggregation Database. Due to the high frequency in the general population, this variant is considered likely benign. REFERENCES Liang et al.

822	risk factor	May 08, 2015	This variant is denoted APC c.3920T>A at the DNA level and p.Ile1307Lys (I1307K) at the protein level, replacing an Isoleucine with a Lysine. APC Ile1307Lys is a common variant, observed at an allele frequency of 3.7% (371/10,138) in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry in large population cohorts (Lek 2016) and in up to 11% of individuals in Ashkenazi Jewish cohorts in the literature (Liang 2013, Boursi 2013). A meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies of APC polymorphisms suggests that individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry who carry this variant have a 2-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer (Liang 2013). However, studies of this variant in other populations did not report an increased risk of colorectal cancer (Liang 2013); therefore, the clinical significance in individuals without Jewish ancestry is not clear at this time. In sum, we consider APC Ile1307Lys to be a risk allele. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has management guidelines for individuals carrying the APC Ile1307Lys risk allele (NCCN).

822	risk factor	Jan 14, 2019	This sequence change replaces isoleucine with lysine at codon 1307 of the APC protein (p.Ile1307Lys). The isoleucine residue is weakly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between isoleucine and lysine. This variant is present in population databases (rs1801155, ExAC 0.3%). This variant is found in ~10% of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and ~3% of Sephardic Jewish individuals (PMID: 23896379). Other studies have reported a 6-7% frequency in Ashkenazi individuals (PMID: 9288102). This variant is found in ~28% of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with familial colorectal cancer (PMID: 9288102). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 822). In a large meta-analysis involving ~10,000 cases and controls (PMID: 23576677), Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who carried the I1307K change had a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.65-2.86). By contrast, the I1307K change did not appear to confer any additional risk of colorectal cancer in non-Ashkenazi Jewish individuals (OR=1.36, 95% CI=0.59-3.13). This DNA substitution converts an AAATAAAA sequence element into an extended tract of eight adenosine nucleotides (A8). The A8 mononucleotide tract created by this change has been shown to confer an increased propensity for somatic truncating mutations on this allele (PMID: 9751605). In summary, this is a frequently observed variant that is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. An increased risk of colorectal cancer in individuals who are not of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry has not been established.

822	risk factor	Jun 02, 2017	The c.3920T>A (p.Ile1307Lys) variant in the APC gene has been reported as a common risk allele associated with familial colorectal cancer in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [PMID 18770064, 24416237]. The c.3920T>A variant has been reported to result in an adenine replacing a thymine and creating an oligo-adenine (A8) tract that appears to be inherently prone to further somatic mis-pairing and slippage during DNA replication, thereby creating a frameshift change [PMID 9288102, 18770064 and 244162370]. However, this variant has also been reported at a high frequency, present in 6% of Ashkenazi Jews and about 28% of Ashkenazim with a family history of colorectal cancer [PMID: 9288102]. Isoleucine at amino acid position 1307 of the APC protein is weakly conserved during evolution. While not validated for clinical use, the SIFT and PolyPhen-2 algorithms predict this variant to be benign. Ashkenazi Jews who carry the p.Ile1307Lys variant are at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia: the risk for colorectal neoplasia in heterozygous Ashkenazi Jewish individuals was estimated to be between 1.7 to 2.17 compared to non carrier individuals [PMID 12173321, 23576677, 23896379]. This variant is classified as as a risk allele with an increased risk for colorectal neoplasia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. However the risk in non Jewish populations has not been determined.

822	risk factor	Jan 01, 2020	This sequence change replaces Isoleucine with Lysine at codon 1307 of the APC protein. The isoleucine residue is mildly conserved among species and is located in a known functional domain of the protein. There is a big physiochemical difference between isoleucine and lysine (Grantham Score 102). This variant is listed in population databases (rs1801155, ExAC 0.3) and is a common finding in individuals of Ashkenazi (~6-10%) and Sephardic Jewish decent (~3%; PMID: 9288102 ,23896379 ).Multiple studies have associated this variant with a moderate increase in the risk of colorectal cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, in whom this variant is identified in 28% of cases with familial colorectal cancer (PMID: 9288102 ). In a recent meta-analysis the risk of colorectal cancer development was estimated to be increased 2-fold in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals carrying this variant, while this increase was not evident in other populations (PMID: 23576677). The mutation database ClinVar contains multiple entries for this variant (Variation ID:822).

823	Pathogenic	Oct 05, 2018	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the APC gene (p.Glu1538Ilefs*5). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 1,306 amino acids (46%) of the APC protein. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in several individuals affected with familial adenomatous polyposis (PMID: 8162051, 20223039,Â¬â€ 20513532,Â¬â€ 20685668, 21643010, 21779980, 22987206). This variant has been reported in individuals in the Universal Mutation Database (PMID: 8594558). This variant results in the removal of functional domains of the APC protein, including the basic domain, the EB1 binding site, and the HDLG binding site, which mediate interactions with the cytoskeleton (PMID: 15311282, 17293347). Different truncations downstream of this variant, p.Tyr2645Lysfs*14 and p.Asp1942Glufs*27, have been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 1316610, 8381579, 9824584, 22135120, 15108286, 11001924). While functional studies have not been performed to directly test the effect of this variant on APC protein function, these observations suggest that deletion of the C-terminal portion of the APC protein is causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

841	Pathogenic	Sep 25, 2016	This variant is a gross deletion of the genomic region encompassing exon 16 of the APC gene. The 5' boundary is likely confined to intron 15. The 3' end of this event is unknown as it extends through the termination codon beyond the assayed region for this gene and may encompass additional genes. While this deletion is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to create a truncated APC protein by eliminating 1911 aa (~65%) from the protein. Loss-of-function variants in APC are known to be pathogenic. Similar deletions of exon 16 have been reported in the literature in individuals affected with adenomatous polyposis (PMID: 17568392). In addition, multiple truncations (PMID: 1338764, 20685668, 10083733, 1316610, Invitae database) within this exon have been reported to be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

868	Pathogenic	Dec 18, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with serine at codon 164 of the FBP1 protein (p.Gly164Ser). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glycine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918188, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been reported to segregate with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency in multiple families (PMID: 9382095, 27101822, 25601412, 20096900, 25601412). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 868). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts FBP1 enzyme activity (PMID: 9382095, 20096900).

880	Pathogenic	May 24, 2018	Variant summary: ARSB c.1214G>A (p.Cys405Tyr) results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the encoded protein sequence. Though the variant is located at an exon-intron junction, 5/5 computational tools predict no significant impact on normal splicing. These predictions have been confirmed by functional studies, where full-length mRNA containing the mutation c.1214G>A was detected (Jin 1992, Karageorgos 2007), predicted to result in a protein with the missense change p.C405Y. Three of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 2e-05 in 246184 control chromosomes. This frequency is lower than expected for a pathogenic variant in ARSB causing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome) (2e-05 vs 0.0022), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.1214G>A has been reported in the literature in individuals affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome) presenting with a slowly progressing, milder disease phenotype (Jin 1992, Karageorgos 2007). These data indicate that the variant is likely to be associated with disease. These publications also reported experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity (Jin 1992, Karageorgos 2007). One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation, and classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

883	Uncertain significance	Apr 19, 2018	Variant summary: ARSB c.215T>A (p.Leu72Gln) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Sulfatase, N-terminal domain (IPR000917) of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant was absent in 30582 control chromosomes (gnomAD). The available data on variant occurrences in the general population are insufficient to allow any conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.215T>A, has been reported in the literature in one individual affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome)(Isbrandt_1995), together with the likely pathogenic (in our internal database) variant c.219_230delinsG (p.Asp73fsX50) on the same allele and c.743delC (p.Pro248Leufs*5) on the other allele, suggesting a potential benign effect. The same publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function, however, does not allow convincing conclusions about the variant effect. However, one clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and classified the variant as pathogenic. In addition, multiple reports in HGMD related to other variants affecting this codon suggest this might be a hotspot. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as uncertain significance.

885	Pathogenic	Nov 02, 2017	Variant summary: The ARSB c.629A>G (p.Tyr210Cys) variant located in the Sulfatase, N-termail (via InterPro) involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide and 5/5 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant. A functional study, Brands_2013, supports these predictions by observing the variant to cause a significant decrease in ARSB activity in comparison to wild type. This variant was found in 75/277016 control chromosomes (gnomAD), predominantly observed in the European (Non-Finnish) subpopulation at a frequency of 0.000569 (72/126548), which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic ARSB variant (0.0022361). Multiple publications have cited the variant homozygously and in compound heterozygosity in affected individuals and indicated the variant to be one of the of most common mutations (Karageorgos_2007). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

885	Pathogenic	Dec 11, 2019	This sequence change replaces tyrosine with cysteine at codon 210 of the ARSB protein (p.Tyr210Cys). The tyrosine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between tyrosine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs118203943, ExAC 0.07%). This variant has been observed in several individuals and families affected with ARSB-related conditions (PMID: 8651289, 21514195, 24221504, 23557332, 17458871). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 885). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change has a deleterious effect on protein function (PMID: 8651289, 11939792, 23557332).

This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another ARSB variant in individuals affected with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (PMID: 17458871, 11939792). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 886). This variant has been reported to affect ARSB protein function (PMID: 8651289). This variant disrupts the p.His393 amino acid residue in ARSB. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with ARSB-related conditions (PMID: 26609033), which suggests that this may be a clinically significant amino acid residue. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

886	Pathogenic	May 27, 2015	The H393P variant in the ARSB gene is a common MPS VI variant that has been reported in thehomozygous and the compound heterozygous state in multiple unrelated individuals withmucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI). Patients with the H393P variant who were compoundheterozygous for different missense variants were reported with variable disease severity (Litjens et al.,1996; Karageorgos et al., 2007). Functional studies of the H393P substitution indicate that it is a severe nullallele resulting in an undetectable enzyme level (Litjens et al., 1996). The H393P variant was notobserved with any significant frequency in approximately 6500 individuals of European and AfricanAmerican ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variantin these populations. The H393P variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at aposition that is conserved across species. Missense variants in nearby residues (E390K and F399L) havebeen reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with MPS VI (Stenson et al., 2014),supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. We interpret H393P as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000517248.3	ARSB	-

887	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The ARSB c.1143-1G>C variant occurs in a canonical splice site (acceptor) and is predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product. The c.1143-1G>C variant has been reported in four studies in which it is found in at least 14 individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis, type VI, including one who carried the variant in a homozygous state and 13, including two siblings, who carried the variant in a compound heterozygous state (Garrido et al. 2007; Karageorgos et al. 2007; Garrido et al. 2008; Giraldo et al. 2016). The clinical phenotypes of these patients ranged from intermediate to severe. The c.1143-1G>C variant was absent from 50 controls and is not found in the 1000 Genomes Project, the Exome Sequencing Project, or the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies showed that the variant resulted in lower levels of protein compared to wildtype, a range of 1-23% enzyme activity compared to controls, was subject to nonsense-mediated decay, and did not fully correctly localize to the lysosome (Karageorgos et al. 2007; Garrido et al. 2008). Based on the potential impact of splice acceptor variants and the evidence from the literature, the c.1143-1G>C variant is classified as pathogenic for mucopolysaccharidosis, type VI. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

887	Pathogenic	Nov 18, 2016	Variant summary: The ARSB c.1143-1G>C variant substitutes a highly conserved nucleotide at the canonical splice acceptor site in intron 5. 4/5 splice prediction tools predict abrogation of the splice acceptor site. The prediction results are verified by a functional assay: RT-PCR on a patients fibroblasts showed skipping of exon 6 (Garrido_2007). Exon 6 is encodes a part of alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain (InterPro), thus skipping of exon 6 is expected to form non-functional protein. This variant is absent in 121248 control chromosomes from the broad and large populations of ExAC. It is found in several patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI with consistent recessive genotypes including evidence of cosegregation with disease (Karageorgos_2007, Garrido_2007, and Garrido_2015). In addition, multiple clinical reputable databases have classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as Pathogenic.

887	Pathogenic	Nov 25, 2019	This sequence change affects an acceptor splice site in intron 5 of the ARSB gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with mucopolysaccharidosis VI (PMID: 17458871). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 887). Experimental studies have shown that this variant disrupts mRNA splicing (PMID: 18406185). Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in ARSB are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 17458871, 22133300).

900	Pathogenic	Mar 29, 2018	Variant summary: GUSB c.1521G>A (p.Trp507X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 1.1e-05 in 270504 control chromosomes. This frequency is not higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in GUSB causing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (Sly Syndrome) (1.1e-05 vs 0.0011), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.1521G>A has been reported in the literature in two individuals affected with severe Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (Sly Syndrome) (Vervoort 1996, Yamada 1995). These data indicate that the variant may be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence showing that B-glucuronidase enzyme activity of the variant allele was less than 10% of a normal control (Yamada 1995). No clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

905	Pathogenic	Aug 16, 2019	Variant summary: GUSB c.526C>T (p.Leu176Phe) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Glycosyl hydrolases family 2, sugar binding domain (IPR006104) of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 5.6e-05 in 250940 control chromosomes (gnomAD). c.526C>T has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII (Sly Syndrome) (Wu_1994, Vervoort_1996, Schwartz_2003, Montano_2016). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. Functional studies found the variant to have <10% of normal activity (Wu_1994, Puxan_2018). In addition, a knock-in mouse model with the L175F mutation, corresponding to the L176F variant in humans, exhibited phenotypic characteristics typical of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII (Tomatsu_2002). A ClinVar submission (evaluation after 2014) cite the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

908	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The GUSB c.1069C>T (p.Arg357Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant that has been reported in at least five studies where it is found in a total of nine individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis, type VII, including four in a homozygous state and five in a compound heterozygous state (Shipley et al. 1993; Vervoort et al. 1995; Vervoort et al. 1996; Vervoort et al. 1997; Shamseldin et al. 2015). Three of the homozygous individuals are related, representing a parent and two prenatally diagnosed fetuses. The p.Arg357Ter variant was found to segregate with disease in at least one family (Shipley et al. 1993). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00003 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium, but this is based on two alleles in a region of good sequencing coverage so the variant is presumed to be rare. Expression of the p.Arg357Ter variant in COS-7 cells resulted in no enzyme activity and analysis of total RNA from cultured fibroblasts revealed reduced amounts of variant mRNA and aberrant bands suggesting aberrant splicing (Shipley et al. 1993; Vervoort et al. 1996). Based on the evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Arg357Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for mucopolysaccharidosis, type VII.

909	Pathogenic	Nov 07, 2016	The H435Y pathogenic variant in the CYP4F22 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in patients with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (Lefevre et al., 2006; Noguera-Morel et al., 2016). It was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. H435Y is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. A missense variant in a nearby residue (H436D) has been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with lamellar ichthyosis with hyperlinearity of palms and soles (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. In addition, functional studies of the CYP4F22 protein containing the H435Y variant have shown that the presence of this variant significantly decreases omega-hydroxylase activity compared to the wild-type protein (Ohno et al., 2015). Therefore, we interpret H435Y as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000490953.2	CYP4F22	-

923	Uncertain significance	Jun 21, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 49 of the GLB1 protein (p.Arg49Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72555358, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been observed in combination with a pathogenic GLB1 variant in an individual affected withÂ¬â€ GM1-gangliosidosis (PMID:Â¬â€ 15365997) and as heterozygous (no second variant identified) in an individual with the same disease (PMID:Â¬â€ 1909089).Â¬â€ ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 923). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. The observation of one or more missense substitutions at this codon (p.Arg49CysÂ¬â€ andÂ¬â€ p.Arg49His) in affected individuals suggests that this may be a clinically significant residue (PMID:Â¬â€ 15365997,Â¬â€ 15986423). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 923).

Expression in Cos-1 cells found that R201C is associated with approximately 12%-8% of wild-type beta-galactosidase activity (Hofer el al., 2009; Caciotti et al. 2003). The R201C variant was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

925	Likely pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The GLB1 c.601C>T (p.Arg201Cys) missense variant has been reported in four studies in which it is found in a total of eight individuals with GM1 gangliosidosis including in one in a homozygous state, in three in a compound heterozygous state, and in four in a heterozygous state where a second variant was not identified (Yoshida et al. 1991; Nishimoto et al 1991; Caciotti et al 2003; Takenouchi et al 2015). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00005 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Caciotti et al. (2003) investigated the functional impact of GLB1 variants through expression studies in COS-1 cells and demonstrated that the p.Arg201Cys variant resulted in 12.9% of wild type activity. Based on the evidence, the p.Arg201Cys variant is classified as likely pathogenic for GM1 gangliosidosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

925	Pathogenic	Jan 20, 2017	Four cases affected by GM1 gangliosidosis type II from three consanguineous families showed a homozygote missense mutation in GLB1 gene (c. 601 G> A, p.R201C). Their clinical findings were as follow: Family I, Patient I: A 6.5-year-old girl was referred to the Pediatric Neurology Department in the Mofid Children Hospital, Tehran, Iran due to progressive ataxia and neurodevelopmental regression. She was born from a consanguineous marriage (first-degree cousins) with uneventful birth history. She had normal neurodevelopmental milestones up to the age of three years when she developed progressive ataxia. She gradually lost her lingual and motor skills and became wheelchair-dependent by the age of 5 years. Although she was reported to have normal intellectual abilities, her mental abilities decreased over the course of disease. Detailed neurological exam was performed in the first admission and in the subsequent visits, which revealed neurodevelopmental regression, reduction of age-related intellectual abilities and nystagmus. The â€œFix and Follow testâ€ of moving objects was not normal and she gradually lost her vision. Two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (in the third and fourth) assessments revealed minor signal changes in the periventricular white matter without any progression (Figure 1a and 1b). Ophthalmologic study did not show any pathologic signs and all metabolic studies were reported in normal range. Electroencephalography (EEG), Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) and Electroretinography (ERG) were normal.. Regarding her family history, 4 members in her motherâ€™s family died due to similar clinical presentations. Family II, Patient II & III: The family had two affected individuals who were referred to the Pediatric Neurology Department in the Mofid Children Hospital, Tehran, Iran due to neurodevelopmental regression. These two siblings, a 9-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, had normal developmental milestones up to the age of 3 years. The boy showed progressive ataxia, dystonia and mental decline. All metabolic studies and routine laboratory data were in normal ranges. MRI study showed mild cerebellar atrophy with mild signal changes in the periventricular white matter (Figure 2). The affected girl had similar symptoms with loss of her acquired motor and lingual abilities after the age of 3 years as well as progressive ataxia, speech problem and neurodevelopmental regression. The parents are first-degree cousins who have one unaffected child and positive history of multiple deceased individuals with similar clinical presentation in their extended family. Family III, Patient IV: The patient is an 8-years old girl, who is already bed-ridden and living in the same village as the family II. She was reported to have similar findings to the family II which include progressive ataxia, neurodevelopmental regression, loss of speech and mental decline started around the age of 3 years. Her parents are first-degree cousins and have history of unexplained death of children in their extended families from both sides.

928	Likely pathogenic	Apr 20, 2016	The G123R variant in the GLB1 gene has been previously reported in one individual with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB disease who also harbored a pathogenic frameshift variant on the other GLB1 allele (Sohn et al., 2012). This variant was also reported in an apparently homozygous state in one individual with GM1-gangliosidosis (Caciotti et al., 2007). The G123R variant was not observed in approximately 6200 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Missense variants in nearby residues (R121S, C127Y) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with GM1-gangliosidosis (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. The G123R variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic variant, however the possibility it may be a rare benign variant cannot be excluded.

935	Pathogenic	Oct 18, 2019	This sequence change replaces threonine with methionine at codon 82 of the GLB1 protein (p.Thr82Met). The threonine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between threonine and methionine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72555393, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed to segregate with GM1-gangliosidosis in a family and has also been observed in several individuals affected with GM1-gangliosidosis (PMID: 25326637, 21520340,8198123, 20175788, 11511921). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 935). This variant has been reported to affect GLB1 protein function (PMID: 8198123). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

936	Pathogenic	May 11, 2018	Variant summary: GLB1 c.75+2dupT is located in a canonical splice-site and is predicted to affect mRNA splicing resulting in a significantly altered protein due to either exon skipping, shortening, or inclusion of intronic material. Several computational tools predict a significant impact on normal splicing: Five predict the variant abolishes a 5 prime splicing donor site. At least one publication reports experimental evidence that this variant affects mRNA splicing. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.00021 in 271704 control chromosomes. This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in GLB1 causing GM1 gangliosidosis (0.00021 vs 0.002), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.75+2dupT has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with GM1 gangliosidosis. These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity. One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014, and classified it as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

936	Pathogenic	May 17, 2016	The c.75+2dupT splice site variant in the GLB1 gene has been previously reported in association with type III (adult) GM1 gangliosidosis. The reported patients also had a less severe missense variant in GLB1 resulting in enough functional ÃŸ-galactosidase enzyme to produce a type III phenotype despite the presence of c.75+2dupT which was found to be associated with barely detectable ÃŸ-galactosidase enzyme activity and is associated with an infantile phenotype when in the homozygous state (Chakraborty et al., 1994). The c.75+2dupT pathogenic variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 1, results in the use of a cryptic splice site, and is expected to cause abnormal gene splicing (Chakraborty et al., 1994).

936	Pathogenic	Dec 16, 2019	This sequence change falls in intron 1 of the GLB1 gene. It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the GLB1 protein, but it affects a nucleotide within the consensus splice site of the intron. This variant is present in population databases (rs766823411, ExAC 0.2%). This variant has been observed in individuals and to segregate with GM1 gangliosidosis in a family (PMID: 8198123, 29160035, 8199591). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 936). Nucleotide substitutions within the consensus splice site are a relatively common cause of aberrant splicing (PMID: 17576681, 9536098). Experimental studies have shown that this variant disrupts mRNA splicing (PMID: 8198123, 8199591). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

945	Pathogenic	Oct 02, 2018	The R59H variant in the GLB1 gene is a common variant in patients with type I (infantile) GM1-gangliosidosis from Brazil having been identified on 20% of alleles from affected patients (Silva et al., 1999). Functional studies in COS-1 cells found that R59H is associated with no residual enzyme activity (Caciotti et al., 2005). The R59H variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The R59H variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. Missense variants in the same (R59C) and nearby residues (S54N, S54I) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with GM1-gangliosidosis (Stenson et al., 2014). We interpret R59H as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000490538.2	GLB1	-

945	Pathogenic	Mar 08, 2018	Across a selection of the available literature, the GLB1 c.176G>A (p.Arg59His) missense variant has been reported in at least three studies and is found in at least 15 individuals with GM1-gangliosidosis, including in ten in a homozygous state and in five in a compound heterozygous state (Silva et al. 1999; Morrone et al. 2000; Santamaria et al. 2007). All of the reported probands presented with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis. The p.Arg59His variant was absent from 200 control chromosomes and is reported at a frequency of 0.000089 in the Latino population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Functional analysis in proband fibroblasts and COS-7 cells found that the p.Arg59His variant exhibited a nearly complete loss of enzymatic activity compared to wild type (Santamaria et al. 2007). Based on the evidence, the p.Arg59His variant is classified as pathogenic for GM1-gangliosidosis.

Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.1e-05 in 120758 control chromosomes. c.176G>A has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVB (Morquio Syndrome B) (Santamaria_2007, Silva_1999), in which two homozygote patients were found to have <10% enzyme activity (Santamaria_2007). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. A ClinVar submssion from a clinical diagnostic laboratory (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as pathogenic.

946	Pathogenic	Mar 26, 2019	This sequence change affects an acceptor splice site in intron 14 of the GLB1 gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs587776526, ExAC 0.002%). This variant has been observed in an individual affected with GM1-gangliosidosis (PMID: 10737981). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 946). Experimental studies have shown that this variant disrupts mRNA splicing (PMID: 10737981). Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in GLB1 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 18524657). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

954	Likely benign	Mar 28, 2016	Variant identified in a genome or exome case(s) and assessed due to predicted null impact of the variant or pathogenic assertions in the literature or databases. Disclaimer: This variant has not undergone full assessment. The following are preliminary notes: Reported in 1 patient with ocular albinism in trans with a splice variant (Lee 1994), 1 Japanese patient with subclinical albinisim who was refered to clinic for severe sunburns (Kawai 2008), 3 Japanese patients with mild disease who has second variants in OCA2 (not clear whether they tested they are in cis or trans) (Suzuki 2003). Transfection of mouse melanocytes with human OCA2 Ala481Thr cDNA resulted in 70% functional activity (Sviderskaya 1997; full text not available). Variant has 4.7% frequency in European population and 20 homozygotes reported in ExAC. ClinVar classification is based on OMIM. Based on the frequency and the studies reporting this variant, it is likely to be a benign variant and lead to a subclinical phenotype at most, therefore does not meet criteria for reporting in BabySeq.	not specified	CN169374:not specified	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine	SCV000539964.1	OCA2	-

955	Pathogenic	Feb 06, 2018	The p.Val443Ile variant in OCA2 has been reported in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in >10 individuals with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 2, including 1 de novo occurrence (Oetting 2005, Hutton 2008, Gargiulo 2011, Zhang 2013, Wolfson 2016, Andersen 2016, Gao 2017). This variant is reported to be th e most common pathogenic OCA2 variant in northern European populations (Hutton 2 008, Lewis 2012) and has been identified in 0.5% (639/125694) of European chromo somes, including 4 homozygous individuals, by the Genome Aggregation Database (g nomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121918166). This frequency is c onsistent with the carrier frequency for OCA type 2. In vitro studies demonstrat ed that the p.Val443Ile variant results in a partial loss of protein function (S viderskaya 1997, Bellono 2014). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be cl assified as pathogenic for OCA type 2 in an autosomal recessive manner. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM3_Very Strong; PM6; PS3_Supporting; PP4.

955	Pathogenic	Apr 05, 2019	The OCA2 c.1327G>A (p.Val443Ile) missense variant has been described as the most common pathogenic variant for oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA) in northern European populations (Lewis et al. 2012). Across a selection of the literature, the p.Val443Ile variant has been reported in at least six studies in which it is found in a total of 15 patients with OCA, including in two in a homozygous state, in ten in a compound heterozygous state, and in three in a heterozygous state (Lee et al. 1994; Oetting et al. 2005; Hutton et al. 2008; Gargiulo et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2015). One homozygote and one compound heterozygote also carried variants in other OCA-related genes. In at least three families, unaffected parents were found to be heterozygous for the p.Val443Ile variant. Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00628 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Functional studies demonstrated that the p.Val443Ile variant protein localized similarly to wild type but showed reduced activity of 85% and reduced pH regulation compared to wild-type (Bellono et al. 2014). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Val443Ile variant is classified as pathogenic for oculocutaneous albinism. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

955	Pathogenic	Jan 10, 2019	The V443I pathogenic variant in the OCA2 gene has been reported previously multiple times in both the homozygous state and in trans with another OCA2 variant in association with oculocutaneous albinism (Lee et al., 1994; Hutton and Spritz, 2008). The V443I variant is observed in 639/125,694 (0.05%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background, including multiple unrelated homozygous individuals, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The V443I variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. However, functional studies demonstrate that the V443I variant disrupts ion conductance, which is required for melanin production (Bellono et al., 2014). We interpret V443I as a pathogenic variant.

956	Likely pathogenic	Jan 25, 2017	The P743L variant in the OCA2 gene has been reported in the homozygous state and in the compound heterozygous state with another OCA2 variant in multiple unrelated individuals with oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (Jaworek et al., 2012; Hutton et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2000; Lee et al., 1994; Sengupta et al., 2010). The P743L variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The P743L variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Additionally, a missense variant in the same residue but resulting in different missense change (P743R) has also been reported in association with oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (Rooryck et al., 2008). Given the available evidence, the P743L variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic variant.

956	Pathogenic	Jul 18, 2018	The p.Pro743Leu variant in Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA type 2) has been reported in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in >7 individuals with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 2 and segregated with disease in 9 affected relatives from 2 families (Lee 1994, Hutton 2008, Sengupta 2010, Jaworek 2012, S hahzad 2017). This variant has also been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID# 956) . This variant has been identified in 0.04% (9/24018) of African chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121918167). This frequency is consistent with the carrier frequency for Oculo cutaneous albinism type 2. Computational prediction tools and conservation analy sis suggest that this variant may impact the protein. In summary, this variant m eets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 in an autosomal recessive manner based upon multiple occurrences with pathogenic OCA2 variants in individuals with Oculocutaneous albinism and segregation with disease in multiple families.

961	Pathogenic	Nov 16, 2016	The N489D pathogenic variant in the OCA2 gene has been reported previously in autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism, in affected individuals who were compound heterozygous for the N489D variant and another variant, and in affected individuals with no second variant identified (Spritz et al., 1997; King et al., 2003; Hutton et al., 2008; Preising et al., 2011). The N489D variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The N489D variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Missense variants in nearby residues (G485R, G485V, D486Y, I491T ) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with oculocutaneous albinism (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.

966	Pathogenic	Nov 26, 2019	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the LCA5 gene (p.Pro384Glnfs*18). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 314 amino acids of the LCA5 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs386834252, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with LCA5-related retinal dystrophy (PMID: 17546029, 26352687). It has also been observed to segregate with disease in related individuals. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 966). This variant disrupts the C-terminus of the LCA5 protein. Other variant(s) that disrupt this region (p.Lys586*) have been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 23946133, 27624628). This suggests that variants that disrupt this region of the protein are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

968	Pathogenic	Dec 24, 2019	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Gln279*) in the LCA5 gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918165, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported as homozygous or compound heterozygous in several individuals affected with Leber congenital amaurosis (PMID: 17546029, 23946133). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 968). Experimental studies have shown that this nonsense change abolishes interaction with intraflagellar transport components (PMID: 21606596). Loss-of-function variants in LCA5 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 17546029, 23946133). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

968	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The LCA5 c.835C>T (p.Gln279Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant that is described in four studies, in which it was found in a homozygous state in five patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and in a compound heterozygous state in three patients with LCA (den Hollander et al. 2007; Jacobson et al. 2009; MacKay et al. 2013; Farwell et al. 2015). The variant was absent from 180 total controls but is reported at a frequency of 0.00035 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Functional studies by Boldt et al. (2011) showed that the p.Gln279Ter variant resulted in a total loss of the protein interactions shown by wild type libercilin with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. IFT-dependent protein transport is an evolutionarily conserved basic mechanism found in all cilia. The variant also caused a loss of additional protein binding capabilities. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Gln279Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for Leber congenital amaurosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

983	Pathogenic	Jul 12, 2017	The R178X nonsense variant in the NHEJ1 gene has been reported previously in association with NHEJ1-SCID (Buck et al., 2006; Cipe et al., 2014; IJspeert et al., 2016). This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Additionally, the variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Therefore, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329430.6	NHEJ1	-

994	Pathogenic	May 11, 2018	Variant summary: XPA c.349_353delCTTAT (p.Leu117GlufsX4) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 7.2e-06 in 276628 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in XPA causing Xeroderma Pigmentosum (7.2e-06 vs 1.60e-03), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.349_353delCTTAT, has been reported in the literature in individuals affected with Xeroderma Pigmentosum (Ghafouri-Fard_2016, Christen-Zaech_2009, States_1998) where it was found to co-segregate with disease. These data indicate that the variant is likely to be associated with disease. At-least one study reports a hypersensitivity of patient derived fibroblasts to the killing effects of UV radiation, although quantitative data were not provided by the authors. No clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014.

1001	Uncertain significance	Apr 11, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with aspartic acid at codon 310 of the MFSD8 protein (p.Gly310Asp). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and aspartic acid. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in multiple individuals affected with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (PMID: 17564970, 19177532). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1001). This variant has been reported not to substantially affect MFSD8 protein function (PMID: 22668694, 17564970). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1004	Pathogenic	Feb 13, 2014	p.Tyr121Cys (TAT>TGT): c.362 A>G in exon 5 of the MFSD8 gene (NM_152778.2)The Tyr121Cys mutation has been reported previously as a homozygous mutation in three siblings with NCL (Stogmann et al., 2009). This mutation is a non-conservative amino acid substitution as these residues differ in properties that are likely to impact the secondary structure of the protein. Additionally, it was not observed in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The variant is found in CHILD-EPI panel(s).	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000241773.11	MFSD8	-

1004	Uncertain significance	Sep 25, 2018	This sequence change replaces tyrosine with cysteine at codon 121 of the MFSD8 protein (p.Tyr121Cys). The tyrosine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between tyrosine and cysteine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to segregate with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses in 3 siblings from a single family (PMID: 18850119). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1004). Experimental studies have found that this variant does not interfere with the proper localization of MFSD8 in transfected cells, but this result does not preclude other undetected effects of this variant (PMID: 20826447). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). In summary, this is a rare variant that has been reported to segregate with disease in a single family. However, in the absence of additional genetic or functional data, its role in disease cannot be conclusively established. For these reasons, this change has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1031	Pathogenic	Jan 12, 2017	The I871T variant in the SETBP1 gene has been reported previously in 5 unrelated individuals with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome and was confirmed to have occured de novo in all individuals for whom parental testing was available (Hoischen et al., 2010). The I871T variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The I871T variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. A missense variant in the same amino acid residue (I871S) has been reported in an individual with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (Takeuchi et al., 2015). Additionally, missense variants in nearby residues (D868N, D868A, G870S, G870D, and G870C) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. We interpret I871T as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000322149.7	SETBP1	-

1056	Pathogenic	Oct 12, 2015	The F52L pathogenic variant in the YARS2 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in several individuals of Lebanese descent with Myopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Sideroblastic Anaemia (MLASA) (Riley et al., 2010; Riley et al., 2013). The F52L variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The F52L variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies have demonstrated that F52L results in reduced mitochondrial tRNATyr aminoacylation activity and reduces the affinity of the mutant protein for tRNATyr, leading to reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis (Riley et al., 2010). We interpret F52L as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329675.6	YARS2	-
1056	Likely pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The homozygous p.Phe52Leu variant in YARS2 was identified by our study in one individual with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia. The p.Phe52Leu variant in YARS2 has been reported in 9 Lebanese individuals with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia, segregated with disease in 4 affected relatives from 2 families (PMID: 24344687, 20598274, 23918765, 30026338), and was been identified in 0.0008957% (1/111650) of European (non-Finnish) chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs267607180). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. This variant has been reported pathogenic in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1056). Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Phe52Leu variant may impact protein function due to a deleterious effect on tRNATyr aminoacylation and mitochrondrial protein synthesis, which may explain the reduced levels of mitochondrial proteins in muscle cells from affected individuals (PMID: 20598274). However, these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. In summary, although more studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, the p.Phe52Leu variant is likely pathogenic.

1062	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The DARS2 c.492+2T>C variant occurs in a canonical splice site (donor) and is therefore predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product. This variant has been reported in at least seven studies, in which it was found in a compound heterozygous state in a total of 22 patients with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation, 17 of whom carried the c.492+2T>C variant in trans with the most common pathogenic DARS2 variant (Scheper et al. 2007; Isohanni et al. 2010; Steenweg et al. 2012; Moore et al. 2012, Martikainen et al. 2013; Alibas et al. 2014; Tylki-Szymanska et al. 2014). Based on in silico analysis, the c.492+2T>C variant is predicted to affect splicing of intron five and cause exon skipping (Scheper et al. 2007; Martikainen et al. 2013). The variant was identified in two out of 575 control subjects in a heterozygous state (Scheper et al. 2007; Isohanni et al. 2010) and is reported at a frequency of 0.00136 in the European (Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Based on the collective evidence, the c.492+2T>C variant is classified as pathogenic for leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1062	Pathogenic	Mar 14, 2018	The c.492+2T>C pathogenic variant in the DARS2 gene has been reported previously in combination with another pathogenic DARS2 variant in multiple unrelated individuals with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) (Scheper et al., 2007; Isohanni et al., 2010; Martikainen et al., 2013; Tylki-Szymanska et al., 2014). This splice site variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 5. It is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or to an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation. The c.492+2T>C variant is observed in 9/6,612 (0.14%) alleles from individuals of Finnish background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.492+2T>C as a pathogenic variant.

1068	Uncertain significance	Apr 28, 2017	The RPGRIP1L c.697A>T (p.Lys233Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant that is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Lys233Ter variant has been reported in one study in which it is found in one individual with cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome (also known as Joubert syndrome type B) in a compound heterozygous state with a missense variant (Delous et al. 2007). The p.Lys233Ter variant was absent from 260 control chromosomes but is reported at a frequency of 0.00002478 in the total population from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Due to the potential impact of stop-gained variants and supporting evidence, the p.Lys233Ter variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for RPGRIP1L-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1069	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change replaces threonine with proline at codon 615 of the RPGRIP1L protein (p.Thr615Pro). The threonine residue is weakly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between threonine and proline. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918198, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous and in combination with another RPGRIP1L variant in individuals with cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome (Joubert syndrome type B) (PMID: 17558407, 17558409, 21866095, 18565097, 17960139, 26092869). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1069). Experimental studies have shown used that this missense change causes a reduction in RPGRIP1L protein binding to nephrocystin-4 (PMID: 17558409). Additionally, this variant failed to rescue the mutant phenotype in zebrafish morpholino experiments (PMID: 19430481). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies.

1069	Pathogenic	Apr 06, 2016	The T615P pathogenic variant in the RPGRIP1L gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state or in trans with another pathogenic RPGRIP1L variant in multiple individuals with Joubert syndrome and related disorders (Arts et al., 2007; Delous et al., 2007; Brancati et al., 2008). The T615P variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Although the T615P missense substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved, the T615P variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In vitro studies indicate that T615P significantly disrupts Nephrocystin-4 binding activity (Arts et al., 2007; Delous et al., 2007). We interpret T615P as a pathogenic variant.

1074	Uncertain significance	Apr 08, 2019	The RPGRIP1L c.2614C>T (p.Gln872Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Gln872Ter variant has been reported in one study in which it was found in a compound heterozygous state with a second stop-gained variant in a fetus diagnosed with Meckel syndrome (Delous et al. 2007). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00005 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Based on the limited evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Gln872Ter variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for RPGRIP1L -related disorders.

1088	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The FLVCR2 c.329_334delACATCT (p.Asn110_Phe112delinsIle) variant is an inframe deletion variant which has been reported in two studies in which it was identified in a compound heterozygous state with a missense variant in one of five families with proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (also known as Fowler syndome) (Meyer et al. 2010). Lalonde et al. (2010) described a second affected fetus in the same family reported by Meyer et al. (2010) to have the same genotype. The p.Asn110_Phe112delinsIle variant was absent from 468 control individuals of Asian and European descent (Meyer et al. 2010) but is reported at a frequency of 0.00006 in the European (non-Finnish) population in the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The evidence for this variant is limited. The p.Asn110_Phe112delinsIle variant is therfore classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome.

1091	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The FLVCR2 c.839C>G (p.Pro280Arg) variant has been reported in a single study in which it was identified in a compound heterozygous state with a null variant in one of five families with proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (also known as Fowler syndrome) (Meyer et al. 2010). The variant was absent from 936 control chromosomes but is reported at a frequency of 0.00001 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. This frequency is based on a single allele only in an area of good coverage so the variant is presumed rare. The evidence for this variant is limited. The p.Pro280Arg variant is therefore classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for Fowler syndrome.

The variant of interest was observed in the large, broad control population, ExAC, with an allele frequency of 2/121034 (1/60517), which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic AGL variant of 1/438. Multiple publications have cited the variant in affected individuals, who were homozygous and compound heterozygous. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as likely pathogenic/pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1096	Pathogenic	Jan 11, 2018	Variant summary: The AGL c.2039G>A (p.Trp680X) variant results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncated or absent AGL protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. A truncation downstream of this position has been classified as pathogenic by our laboratory (c.2929C>T, p.Arg977X). One in silico tool predicts a damaging outcome for this variant. One functional study showed no GSD residual activity in GSD IIIa patients homozygous for this variant in leukocytes, fibroblasts, and/or liver tissue, and/or muscle tissue (Sentner_2012). This variant was found in 2/245574 control chromosomes in gnomAD at a frequency of 0.0000081, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic AGL variant (0.0022822).This variant has been reported in 4 homozygous patients of Caribbean origin with GSD IIIa (Sentner_2012) and also in one patient diagnosed with GSD type IIIb in compound heterozygosity with AGL c.16C>T (p.Gln6Ter)( Shen_AGL_JCI_1996). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

This variant is present in population databases (rs113994129, ExAC 0.003%). This variant has been observed in an individual affected with glycogen storage disease type III (GSDIII) (PMID: 8755644, 23430490). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1096). Loss-of-function variants in AGL are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 19299494). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1096	Pathogenic	Jun 26, 2017	The W680X nonsense variant in the AGL gene has been reported previously in association with glycogen storage disease type IIIb in an individual compound heterozygous with a pathogenic variant on the opposite allele (Shen et al., 1996). However, W680X has also been reported in four homozygous individuals with hepatomegaly, mild or no cardiac involvement, mild skeletal myopathy, and elevated CK levels, suggesting more of a type IIIa phenotype (Sentner et al., 2013). This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Therefore, W680X is interpreted to be pathogenic.

1098	Pathogenic	Aug 24, 2017	This sequence change deletes 1 nucleotide from exon 33 of the AGL mRNA (c.4456delT), causing a frameshift at codon 1486. This creates a premature translational stop signal in the last exon of the AGL mRNA (p.Ser1486Profs*18). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 47 amino acids of the AGL protein. This variant has been reported in individuals affected with glycogen storage disease III (PMID: Â¬â€ 27065010, 25602008 9412782, 25388549, 27460348).

1108	Pathogenic	Dec 10, 2018	Variant summary: AGL c.3980G>A (p.Trp1327X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. Truncations downstream of this position have been classified as pathogenic by our laboratory (eg. c.4221delA, p.Lys1407fsX8 and c.4529dupA, p.Tyr1510X). The variant allele was found at a frequency of 5.8e-05 in 276740 control chromosomes (gnomAD). c.3980G>A has been reported in the literature in multiple homozygous individuals affected with Glycogen Storage Disease Type III and indicated to be a Tunisian founder mutation (Cherif_2012). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. To our knowledge, no experimental evidence demonstrating an impact on protein function has been reported. Four ClinVar submissions from clinical diagnostic laboratories (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as likely pathogenic/pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

1112	Pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The heterozygous p.Met245ValfsTer2 variant in SPG11 was identified by our study in the compound heterozygous state, along with another pathogenic variant, in two siblings with spastic paraplegia. The presence of this variant in combination with a reported pathogenic variant and in an individual with spastic paraplegia increases the likelihood that the p.Met245ValfsTer2 variant is pathogenic. The p.Met245ValfsTer2 variant in SPG11 has been well-reported in the literature. This variant has been reported in greater than 22 individuals from Italy, Japan, France, Tunisia, Sicily, Korea, Spain, China, and Portugal with spastic paraplegia in the homozygous and compound heterozygous state, segregated with disease in 12 affected relatives from 5 families (PMID: 17717710, 20110243, 17322883, 18079167, 22175763, 18332254, 24833714, 22696581, 22237444, 18067136, 18835492), but has been identified in 0.006133% (17/277208) of chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs312262720). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. This variant has also been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1112). This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, which alters the proteinâ€™s amino acid sequence beginning at position 245 and leads to a premature termination codon 2 amino acids downstream. This alteration is then predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Loss of function of the SPG11 gene is an established disease mechanism in autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia. In summary, the p.Met245ValfsTer2variant is pathogenic based off of our findings, multiple reports of pathogenicity in ClinVar, and the literature. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM2, PVS1, PM3, PP1_Moderate (Richards 2015).

1112	Pathogenic	Dec 15, 2019	This sequence change deletes 2 nucleotides in exon 4 of the SPG11 mRNA (c.733_734delAT), causing a frameshift at codon 245. This creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Met245Valfs*2) and is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. Loss-of-function variants in SPG11 are known to be pathogenic. This particular variant has been reported in many individuals affected with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum, also known as ARHSP-TCC (PMID: 17322883, 17717710, 18067136, 18079167, 18332254, 18835492, 19105190, 19438933, 22175763, 22237444, 22696581, 24833714, 27071356). It has also been reported in two siblings affected with juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PMID: 20110243). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1112	Pathogenic	Nov 08, 2017	The c.733_734delAT pathogenic variant in the SPG11 gene has been reported previously in association with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another pathogenic variant (Stevanin et al., 2007; Boukhris et al., 2008). The c.733_734delAT variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Methionine 245, changes this amino acid to a Valine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 2 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Met245ValfsX2. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The c.733_734delAT variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret c.733_734delAT as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000322440.7	SPG11	-

1114	Pathogenic	Dec 20, 2019	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 2 of the SPG11 gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). Disruption of this splice site has been observed in individual(s) with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PMID: 18067136, 23733235, 20390432). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1114). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in SPG11 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 19105190, 20110243, 22154821).

1115	Pathogenic	Sep 23, 2019	This sequence change affects an acceptor splice site in the last intron (intron 39) of the SPG11 gene. While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it likely alters RNA splicing and results in a disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs200079802, ExAC 0.04%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another SPG11 variant in several individuals and families affected with SPG11-related conditions (PMID: 19194956, Invitae). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1115). Nucleotide substitutions within the consensus splice site are a relatively common cause of aberrant splicing (PMID: 17576681, 9536098). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies.

This variant has been reported in at least two studies, in which it is found in a total of six unrelated individuals with congenital sideroblastic anemia, including in two in a homozygous state and in four in a compound heterozygous state with a second missense or truncating variant (Guernsey et al. 2009; Kannengiesser et al. 2011). This variant is not reported in individuals with pyridoxine-refractory sideroblastic anemia. Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.001454 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Tyr109LeufsTer43 variant is classified as likely pathogenic for SLC25A38-related disorders.

1120	Likely pathogenic	Nov 09, 2018	The SLC25A38 c.560G>C (p.Arg187Pro) missense variant has been reported in three studies and has been found in five individuals, including a sibling pair, with congenital sideroblastic anemia. One individual was homozygous for the variant while the others were compound heterozygous for the variant (Guernsey et al. 2009; Kannengiesser et al. 2011; An et al. 2015). The SLC25A38 p.Arg187Pro variant was absent from 251 healthy population controls but is reported at a frequency of 0.000116 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project, however this is based on a single allele in a region of good sequencing coverage and the variant is presumed to be rare. Based on the evidence, the SLC25A38 p.Arg187Pro variant is classified as likely pathogenic for pyridoxine-refractory sideroblastic anemia.

1140	Likely pathogenic	Mar 25, 2019	The c.527dupG variant in the STRA6 gene has been reported previously as apparently homozygous in a fetus with features of Matthew-Wood syndrome (Golzio et al., 2007). The c.527dupG variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Serine 177, changes this amino acid to a Glutamine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 58 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Ser177GlnfsX58. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Although not observed as homozygous, the c.527dupG variant is observed in 2/33530 (0.006%) alleles from individuals of Latino background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.527dupG as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV001168315.1	STRA6	-

1143	Pathogenic	Oct 05, 2018	The HYLS1 c.632A>G (p.Asp211Gly) missense variant has been reported in at least three overlapping studies in which it has been found in a homozygous state in 64 Finnish individuals with hydrolethalus syndrome (HS) and was shown to segregate with disease (Salonen et al. 1990; Mee et al. 2005; Paetau et al. 2008). The p.Asp211Gly variant is actually the only variant to be associated with HS in Finland and has only been reported in the Finnish population where the carrier frequency ranges from 1.1% in the Western part of the country to 2.5% in Central and Eastern Finland (Mee et al. 2005; Paetau et al. 2008). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.01515 in the Finnish population of the 1000 Genomes Project. Functional studies by Honkala et al. (2009) demonstrated that the p.Asp211Gly variant resulted in changes in expression of genes from different pathways, a decreased transactivation capacity, elevated cell proliferation rate and decreased apoptosis rate compared to wild type, as well as an elevated cholesterol rate due to the downregulation of gene involved in lipid metabolism. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Asp211Gly variant is classified as pathogenic for hydrolethalus syndrome. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

This variant has been observed in individuals with hydrolethalus syndrome and it has been reported to be a founder mutation in the Finnish population (PMID: 15843405, 18648327). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1143). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes mislocalization of the HYLS1 protein to the nucleus (PMID: 15843405).

1143	Pathogenic	Jan 27, 2016	The c.632A>G (p.Asp211Gly) missense variant in the HYLS1 gene has been previously reported in 24 affected individuals with autosomal recessive Hydrolethalus syndrome from 16 families in Finland; this variant was shown to co-segregate with disease in these families (Mee et al., 2005). The residue encoded by this variant is positioned at a protease cleavage site, which is lost upon substitution to glycine (Paetau et al., 2008). Functional studies show this variant affects the subcellular localization, sequestering the protein primarily to the nucleus as opposed to the cytoplasm (Mee et al., 2005). This c.632A>G has been reported at low frequency in the three control population databases (Exome Sequencing Project [ESP] , 1000 Genomes, and ExAC). Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest a deleterious effect. Therefore, this collective evidence supports the classification of the c.632A>G (p.Asp211Gly) as a recessive Pathogenic variant for Hydrolethalus syndrome.

1145	Pathogenic	Jun 06, 2018	The Y122C variant in the HIBCH gene has been reported previously in the compound heterozygous state with a splicing variant in a patient with 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase deficiency who exhibited hypotonia, poor feeding, developmental delay and regression, ketoacidosis, and basal ganglia abnormalities (Loupatty et al., 2007). The Y122C variant is in 15/245850 (0.006%) alleles in large population cohorts, with no homozygotes observed (Lek et al., 2016). The Y122C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Functional studies indicate that Y122C demonstrates normal protein expression with reduced enzyme activity (Loupatty et al., 2007). We interpret Y122C as a pathogenic variant.

This variant is present in population databases (rs121918327, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been reported to segregate with Bardet-Biedl syndrome in two families (PMID: 17160889). In these families, the variant was homozygous in all three affected individuals while both sets of consanguineous parents were heterozygous carriers. In addition, seven unaffected siblings from these families were also tested and CN517202 were homozygous for this variant. This variant has also been observed in a sporadic Bardet-Biedl syndrome individual who carried a second pathogenic variant (p.Gln300*) (PMID: 23591405).

(2015) identified the c.1681-1G>A variant in a heterozygous state in one patient with HAE with normal C1-INH (type 3 HAE). Factor XII levels were within normal limits in this patient. The c.1681-1G>A variant was absent from 74 control individuals and is reported at a frequency of 0.00077 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Transcript analysis in two compound heterozygous patients and one homozygous patient with factor XII deficiency demonstrated aberrant splicing, suggesting that the c.1681-1G>A splice acceptor variant results in detectable transcript but unstable protein (Schloesser et al. 1995). Based on the collective evidence, the c.1681-1G>A variant is classified as likely pathogenic for F12-related disorders.

1168	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The F12 c.158A>G (p.Tyr53Cys) missense variant, also known as the factor XII Tenri variant, has been reported in one study in which it is found in one consanguineous family (Kondo et al. 1999). Kondo et al. (1999) identified the p.Tyr53Cys variant in a homozygous state in one asymptomatic individual with low but detectable blood antigen and activity levels of factor XII (3% of wild type). The variant was also found in a heterozygous state in the proband's unaffected consanguineous parents and sister who all showed reduced blood antigen and activity levels (35% of wild type). Functional studies showed that the variant protein was extensively degraded intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and that a small amount of factor XII Tenri that forms a disulphide-linked heterodimer with alpha1-microglobulin is secreted into the blood stream. Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is not reported in the 1000 Genomes Project, the Exome Sequencing Project, the Exome Aggregation Consortium or the Genome Aggregation Database. The evidence for this variant is limited. The p.Tyr53Cys variant is classified as unknown significance, but suspicious for pathogenicity for factor XII deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1169	Pathogenic	Sep 17, 2015	The p.Thr328Lys variant in F12 has been reported in at least 18 individuals with hereditary angioedema type 3 (HAE 3), and segregated with disease in >35 affect ed relatives (Dewald 2006, Cichon 2006, Martin 2007, Duan 2009, Picone 2010, Mor eno 2015, Firinu 2015). However, many apparently unaffected family members were also found to carry this variant, which has been partially attributed to both ag e- and sex-dependent penetrance (Dewald 2006, Martin 2007). Of note, the HAE 3 p henotype appears to be estrogen-dependent and males who carry this variant were rarely affected (Dewald 2006, Martin 2007). The p.Thr328Lys variant was also ide ntified in 1/9444 Latino chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs118204456). Please note that for disease s with clinical variability or reduced penetrance, pathogenic variants may be pr esent at a low frequency in the general population. In summary, this variant mee ts our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for HAE 3 in an autosomal dominan t manner based upon segregation studies and low frequency in controls.

1169	Pathogenic	Nov 15, 2018	The T328K variant has been published previously in association with hereditary angioedema (Cichon et al., 2006; Dewald et al., 2006; Bjorkqvist et al., 2015). It was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6,400 individuals of European and African American ancestry by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. T328K is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position not conserved and in silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. A missense variant at the same residue (T328R) has also been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with hereditary angioedema (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Additionally, functional studies of the T328K variant have shown that it leads to loss of glycosylation and increased microvascular leakage upon contact (Bjorkqvist et al., 2015).

1171	Pathogenic	Nov 30, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with histidine at codon 448 of the CYP11B1 protein (p.Arg448His). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and histidine. This variant is present in population databases (rs28934586, ExAC 0.003%). This variant has been observedÂ¬â€ o be homozygous or in combination with another CYP11B1 variant in individuals affected with adrenal hyperplasia (PMID: 16030166, 20024693, 27376433), and has been shownÂ¬â€ to segregate with disease in several families (PMID: 2022736). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1171). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Tolerated"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0").

1173	Pathogenic	Nov 29, 2019	This sequence change replaces threonine with methionine at codon 318 of the CYP11B1 protein (p.Thr318Met). The threonine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between threonine and methionine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894061, ExAC 0.002%). This variant has been observed to segregate with adrenal hyperplasia in a family and has also been observed in several individuals affected with adrenal hyperplasia (PMID: 8506298, 10487675, 28228528). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1173). This variant has been reported to affect CYP11B1 protein function (PMID: 8506298). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1185	Pathogenic	Jun 27, 2018	The p.Tyr423X variant in CYP11B1 has been reported in the compound heterozygote state in 1 individual with non-classic adrenal hyperplasia due to 11 beta-hydrox ylase deficiency (Joehrer 1997). This variant has been identified in 2/126704 Eu ropean chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.bro adinstitute.org; dbSNP rs267606755). This nonsense variant leads to a premature termination codon at position 423 which is predicted to lead to a truncated or a bsent protein. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as patho genic for non-classic adrenal hyperplasia due to 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in an autosomal recessive manner based upon a case report, low frequency in con trols and predicted impact on protein.

1198	Pathogenic	Sep 07, 2016	The R500X variant in the MARVELD2 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state, segregating in several families with autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (Riazuddin et al., 2006; Bademci et al., 2015). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Riazuddin et al. (2006) expressed R500X in e.coli and found that although some R500X mutant mRNA escaped nonsense mediated decay, the truncation negatively affects the occludin-ELL domain, resulting in disrupted MARVELD2 ZO-1 binding capacity. Additionally, expression of R550X in MDCK cells showed that loss of the C-terminal region in the R500X results in mislocalization of the proteins from the tricellular junctions and non-specific targeting of the mutant proteins to basolateral domains of transfected cells (Nayak et al., 2015). The R500X variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Based on this evidence, we interpret R500X as a pathogenic variant.

1198	Pathogenic	Nov 30, 2018	The MARVELD2 c.1498C>T (p.Arg500Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant that is predicted to result in a premature termination of the protein. The p.Arg500Ter variant is reported in a homozygous state in eight individuals from one family with nonsyndromic hearing loss (Riazuddin et al. 2006). The p.Arg500Ter variant was shown to segregate with the disease and was absent from 443 normal hearing subjects matched for ethnicity. The p.Arg500Ter variant is reported at a frequency of 0.00024 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies showed that the p.Arg500Ter variant disrupts the binding of the occludin domain to the scaffolding protein ZO-1 (Riazuddin et al. 2006). Nayak et al. (2013) generated knockin mice that were homozygous for the p.Arg500Ter variant and demonstrated ultrastructural changes in the tricellular junctions in all sensory and nonsensory epithelia of the inner ear organs and cochlear hair cell loss.

(2015) demonstrated that, in a cell line derived from an individual who was homozygous for the p.Arg500Ter variant, total cellular mRNA levels were reduced compared to wild type, especially in the cytoplasmic fraction. Based on the evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Arg500Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1198	Pathogenic	Jun 19, 2014	The p.Arg500X variant in MARVELD2 has been previously reported in one individual with hearing loss and segregated with disease in 7 affected relatives from one family (Riazuddin 2006). It has also been identified in 0.018% (23/126596) of E uropean chromosomes by gnomAD (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). This nonsense variant creates a premature termination codon at position 500 and is predicted t o lead to a truncated or absent protein. Functional and animal studies support t he pathogenicity of the p.Arg500X variant (Riazuddin 2006, Nayak 2013). In summa ry, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for autosomal rec essive sensorineural hearing loss. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM3_Supporting, P P1_Strong, PVS1, PS3.

1204	Pathogenic	Jan 27, 2017	The P357L missense variant in the MAT1A gene has been reported previously in association with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III (MAT I/III) deficiency in a patient who was found to be compound heterozygous for P357L and another variant in the MAT1A gene and who had very low MAT activity in a liver biopsy sample (Ubagai et al., 1995). Expression studies found that P357L is associated with low but detectable MAT enzyme activity (Ubagai et al., 1995). In summary, we interpret P357L in MAT1A to be a pathogenic variant.

1204	Likely pathogenic	Dec 31, 2018	This sequence change replaces proline with leucine at codon 357 of the MAT1A protein (p.Pro357Leu). The proline residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and leucine. This variant is present in population databases (rs118204003, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with isolated hypermethioninemia (PMID:Â¬â€ 7560086,Â¬â€ 15935930). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1204). This variant has been reported to affect MAT1A protein function (PMID:7560086). In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1208	Pathogenic	Jan 09, 2018	The R264H missense variant in the MAT1A gene has been reported in association with autosomal dominant inheritance of methionine adenosyltransferase I/III (MAT I/III) deficiency (Chamberlin et al., 1997; Chamberlin et al., 2000; Couce et al., 2008; Chien et al., 2005). Amino acid 264 in the methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) alpha-1 subunit is reported to be involved in salt-bridge formation that is essential for subunit dimerization. R264/R264H MAT alpha-1 heterodimers are enzymatically inactive; therefore, R264H has a dominant negative effect on the MAT enzyme (Chamberlin et al., 1997). Most individuals with MAT I/III deficiency, particularly those with the R264H subsitution, have elevation of plasma methionine and a relatively benign course, although the elevated methionine may be associated with an unusual breath odor. Therefore, we interpret R264H as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000490609.1	MAT1A	-
1208	Pathogenic	Dec 12, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with histidine at codon 264 of the MAT1A protein (p.Arg264His). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and histidine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72558181, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been reported to segregate with hypermethioninemia in two families (PMID: 9042912). It has also been reported in unrelated individuals with this condition (PMID: 23430947, 24445979, 25638462, 18500573) and this variant is commonly found in the autosomal dominant form of this condition. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1208). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change abrogates MAT1A enzyme activity (PMID: 9042912, 11278456, 23425511). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg264Cys) has been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 10677294, 26289392). This suggests that the arginine residue is critical for MAT1A protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1210	Pathogenic	Apr 18, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 264 of the MAT1A protein (p.Arg264Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in combination with another MAT1A variantÂ¬â€ in individuals affected with the autosomal recessive form of hypermethioninemiaÂ¬â€ (PMID: 10677294, 15935930, 26289392). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1210). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg264His) has been determined to be pathogenic and causes an autosomal dominant form of hypermethioninemiaÂ¬â€ (PMID:Â¬â€ 9042912,Â¬â€ 23430947, 24445979,Â¬â€ 11278456, 23425511).

The p.Glu109Lys variant is described as a founder mutation among the Israeli Moroccan Jewish population (Amir et al. 2011). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.000577 in the African population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Expression analysis in HeLa-Kyoto cells determined the p.Glu109Lys variant had less than 5% of wildtype expression (Schwarz et al. 2009). Based on the evidence, the p.Glu109Lys variant is classified as pathogenic for congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.

1223	Pathogenic	Oct 10, 2016	The R14W variant in the SEC23B gene has been reported previously in association with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II in multiple unrelated individuals when present with a second variant in the SEC23B gene (Bianchi et al., 2009; Schwarz et al., 2009; Satchwell et al., 2013). The R14W variant is one of the most common recurrent variants in the SEC23B gene and is considered a founder mutation in Italy, Morocco, and Israel (Russo et al., 2014). The R14W variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R14W variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved. However, in vitro studies demonstrate that R14W-SEC23B is unstable with less than 5% of the protein detectable compared to wild type (Schwarz et al., 2009). Therefore, we interpret R14W as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000330039.5	SEC23B	-

Several computational tools predict a significant impact on normal splicing: Four predict the variant abolishes a 5 splicing donor site. At least one publication reports experimental evidence that this variant affects mRNA splicing. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.7e-05 in 276088 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in HGSNAT causing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIC (Sanfilippo Syndrome C) (4.7e-05 vs 0.001), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.493+1G>A has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIC (Sanfilippo Syndrome C) (Fan_2006, Hrebicek_2006). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. To our knowledge, no experimental evidence demonstrating an impact on protein function has been reported. A ClinVar submission from another clinical diagnostic laboratory (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as "pathogenic." Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

1230	Pathogenic	Dec 20, 2019	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 4 of the HGSNAT gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs193066451, ExAC 0.04%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with mucopolysaccharidosis type III (PMID: 16960811, 17033958). This variant is also known as c.577+1G>A, p.P193HfsX20 in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1230). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in HGSNAT are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 17033958, 19479962). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1231	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The HGSNAT c.1345dupG (p.Asp449GlyfsTer21) variant results in a frameshift and is expected to result in premature premature truncation of the protein. Fan et al. (2006) reported this variant in a compound heterozygous state with a splicing variant in one of two cell lines from individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis type III-C. The p.Asp449GlyfsTer21 variant is reported at a frequency of 0.00002 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. This frequency is based on one allele in a region of good sequencing coverage, so the variant is presumed to be rare. Based on the limited evidence and the potential impact of frameshift variants, the p.Asp449GlyfsTer21 variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for mucopolysaccharidosis type III. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1232	Likely pathogenic	Sep 26, 2017	The P283L variant in the HGSNAT gene has been reported previously, using alternate nomenclature P311L, in association with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC, in an affected individual who was homozygous for the P283L variant, and in an affected individual who was heterozygous for the P283L variant and another HGSNAT variant (Hrebicek et al., 2006). The P283L variant is observed in 3/18754 (0.016%) alleles from individuals of East Asian background, in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). The P283L variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies show that P283L has reduced enzyme activity compared to wild type and mislocalization due to incorrect protein folding (Feldhammer et al., 2009; Fedele et al., 2010). We interpret P283L as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000617696.2	HGSNAT	-

1232	Likely pathogenic	Aug 14, 2018	This sequence change replaces proline with leucine at codon 283 of the HGSNAT protein (p.Pro283Leu). The proline residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and leucine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121908282, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been observed in individuals affected withÂ¬â€ Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (Sanfilippo C Syndrome)Â¬â€ (PMID:Â¬â€ 17033958).Â¬â€ This variant is also known as P311L in the literature.Â¬â€ ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1232).

In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1236	Pathogenic	Aug 18, 2016	Variant summary: The HGSNAT c.372-2A>G variant involves the alteration of a conserved intronic nucleotide. One in silico tool predicts a damaging outcome for this variant. 5/5 splice prediction tools predict loss of a canonical splicing acceptor site. ESEfinder predicts gain of binding motif for RNA splicing enhancer SRp40. This variant was found in 2/89484 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0000224, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic HGSNAT variant (0.001). This variant has been reported in multiple MPSIIIC patients both as homozygotes and compound heterozygotes. Functional studies showed that this variant cause aberrant splicing and significantly decreased enzyme activity. In addition, multiple reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1237	Pathogenic	Jul 30, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 344 of the HGSNAT protein (p.Arg344Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121908285, ExAC 0.001%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with MPS IIIC (PMID: 17033958, 18024218). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1237). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes HGSNAT protein misfolding, subcellular mislocation and loss of enzymatic activity (PMID: 19823584, 20583299, 20825431). The observation of one or more missense substitutions at this codon (p.Arg344CysÂ¬â€ andÂ¬â€ p.Arg344His) in affected individuals suggests that this may be a clinically significant residue (PMID: 17033958, 18024218).

1245	Pathogenic	May 09, 2017	The PALB2 c.3549C>G;p.Tyr1183Ter variant has been described in individuals and families affected with breast cancer and Fanconi anemia (Rahman 2007, Reid 2007, Tischkowitz 2012). This variant removes four amino acids thought to be critical in the protein structure, which may destabilize the protein (Oliver 2009). In support of this theory, cells derived from individuals with this variant do not produce PALB2 protein (Reid 2007). The variant is listed in the ClinVar database (Variation ID: 1245) and the dbSNP variant database (rs118203998) with an allele frequency of 0.001625 percent in the Genome Aggregation Database. Considering available information, this variant is classified as pathogenic. Pathogenic PALB2 variants increase susceptibility to breast and pancreatic cancer (OMIM#601355).

1245	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the PALB2 gene (p.Tyr1183*). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to delete the last 4 amino acids of the PALB2 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs118203998, ExAC 0.003%). This variant has been observed in individuals affected with breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, and Fanconi anemia (PMID: 17200668, 26315354, 17200671, 21365267, 22241545). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1245). Experimental studies have shown that this variant prevents closure of the WD40 ring structure and destabilizes the PALB2 protein in cell culture (PMID: 19609323). In addition, while truncating mutations close to the end of a protein are generally expected to escape nonsense-mediated RNA decay, there was no detectable PALB2 protein in lymphoblastoid cells from two individuals carrying this variant, indicating that the mutation results in a null allele (PMID: 17200671). Loss-of-function variants in PALB2 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 17200668, 24136930, 25099575). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1253	Pathogenic	Jan 06, 2020	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 5 of the P3H1 gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs72659351, ExAC 0.2%). This variant has been reported in homozygous and compound heterozygous state in several individuals affected with osteogenesis imperfecta (PMID: 17277775, 27509835, 29150909, 22281939). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1253). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in P3H1 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 17277775, 19088120).

1253	Pathogenic	Sep 19, 2018	The P3H1 c.1080+1G>T variant (rs72659351) is a West African founder mutation that has been described in the homozygous and compound heterozygous states in multiple individuals affected with osteogenesis imperfecta (Cabral 2007, Cabral 2012, Fratzl-Zelman 2016). It is reported as pathogenic in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1253) and observed in the African population at an overall frequency of 0.25% (59/24040 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database. This variant abolishes the canonical splice donor site of intron 5, and analysis of fibroblasts from affected patients carrying this variant demonstrated decreased transcript, absent P3H1 protein expression, and impaired collagen secretion (Cabral 2007). Based on available information, this variant is considered pathogenic. REFERENCES Cabral WA et al.

1253	Pathogenic	Dec 06, 2018	The c.1080+1G>T pathogenic variant in the LEPRE1 gene has been reported previously in association with osteogenesis imperfecta when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another disease-causing variant (Cabral et al., 2007; Cabral et al., 2012). This splice site variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 5. It is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or to an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation. Although not present in the homozygous state, the ExAC dataset reports c.1080+1G>T was observed in 59/24040 (0.245%) alleles from individuals of African background, consistent with it being a West African founder variant (Cabral et al., 2012; Lek et al., 2016).

1259	Likely pathogenic	Aug 07, 2017	This sequence change falls in intron 14 of the P3H1 gene. It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the P3H1 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs137853890, ExAC 0.002%). This variant has been reported in individuals affected with autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (PMID: 19088120). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1259). This gene is also known as LEPRE1 in the literature. An experimental study has shown that this variant strengthens a cryptic splice site in intron 14, which results in a decrease of the clinically-relevant transcript and loss of P3H1 protein expression in cells derived from individuals carrying this variant (PMID: 19088120). Truncating variants in the final exon (p.Glu719Argfs*11, p.Q722*) have been reported in individuals affected with autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, and result in loss of P3H1 protein expression (PMID: 22615817, 27864101). These variants eliminate a KDEL domain at the end of the protein (amino acids 733-736), which is important for the cellular retention and activity of certain types of proteins (PMID: 3545499). This suggests that deletion of this region, which is only present in the clinically-relevant P3H1 transcript, is causative of disease. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1260	Pathogenic	Jan 04, 2018	The R69W pathogenic variant in the RNASEH2C gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in multiple individuals from South Asia or the Middle East with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, including two siblings with significantly different presentations, suggesting clinical variability (Rice et al., 2007; Ramantani et al., 2010; Vogt et al., 2013; Al-Shamsi et al., 2016; Hebbar et al., 2018). The R69W variant is observed in 21/30,782 (0.068%) alleles from individuals of South Asian background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The R69W variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Functional studies demonstrate that R69W is associated with decreased enzyme activity and reduced thermal stability of RNaseH2 (Chon et al., 2009; Reijns et al., 2011). We interpret R69W as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000490775.1	RNASEH2C	-

1262	Pathogenic	Dec 28, 2019	This sequence change replaces alanine with threonine at codon 177 of the RNASEH2B protein (p.Ala177Thr). The alanine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between alanine and threonine. This variant is present in population databases (rs75184679, ExAC 0.2%). This variant has been reported in the homozygous state and in combination with other deleterious RNASEH2B variants in multiple individuals affected with Aicardi-Gouti res syndrome (PMID: 16845400, 25243380, 25343331, 26182405, 26846091, 17846997, 20131292, 18754903, 19694776). It has also been reported in several individuals with unspecified neurological disorders (PMID: 25604658). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1262). Experimental studies have reported that this missense change has a mild effect on protein function in vitro and leads to a subclinical phenotype in mice that mimics some aspects of Aicardi-Gouti res syndrome (PMID: 19015152, 26903602). However, in another study it has been reported that this variant has no effect on RNASEH2B enzymatic activity in a bacterial cells (PMID: PMID: 19034401).

The A177T variant is observed in 281/126540 alleles (0.22%) from individuals of non-Finnish European background in the large population cohorts and no individuals were reported to be homozygous (Lek et al., 2016). The A177T variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Although functional studies did not detect loss of ribonuclease H activity, in vitro analyses did indicate that the A177T variant has a destabilizing effect on the RNase H2 enzyme and/or the cellular action of the catalytic subunit, and leads to accumulation of rNMPs in chromosomal DNA (Perrino et al., 2009; Pizzi et al., 2015).

1262	Pathogenic	Jun 14, 2016	The c.529G>A (p.Ala177Thr) variant has been reported in at least four studies in which it is found in an unspecified number of affected individuals in a homozygous state in 48 Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome families and in a heterozygous state in 49 Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome families, in a homozygous state in ten patients (including two siblings), and in a heterozygous state in seven patients (Crow et al. 2006; Rice et al. 2007; Crow et al. 2014; Crow et al. 2015). Three of the heterozygous individuals in Crow et al. (2015) also carried a homozygous variant in a second gene. In the study by Rice et al. (2007) (which included the patients reported by Crow et al. 2006), the p.Ala177Thr variant accounted for 60 out of the 97 RNASEH2B variants detected, and was the most frequently identified pathogenic variant in all of the cases reviewed. The p.Ala177Thr variant was found in a heterozygous state in one of 582 control alleles and is reported at a frequency of 0.00291 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ala177Thr variant is classified as pathogenic for Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.

Another >50 individuals were heterozygou s for this variant, though it is unclear if they were compound heterozygous for another variant in this gene or not. Although a second variant was not identifie d in a large number of individuals, the allele frequency in cases is statistical ly significantly increased compared to the general population (168/446 from lite rature vs 128/66494 ExAC, p value 0.0001 (Chi-square with Yates correction), sug gesting a causative role. This variant has also been reported in ClinVar (Variat ion ID#1262) as pathogenic by multiple laboratories. In vitro functional studies provide conflicting data ( Lim 2015 and Pizzi 2015). Homozygous mouse models de monstrate phenotypes similar to Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (Mackenzie 2016). Thi s variant has been identified in 0.19% (128/66494) of European chromosomes by th e Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs75 184679). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its freq uency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summ ary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical si gnificance, the p.Ala177Thr variant is likely pathogenic for Aicardi-Goutieres s yndrome in an autosomal recessive manner based upon segregation studies, animal models, functional evidence and its occurrence in patients with this disease.

1264	Pathogenic	May 08, 2018	The c.660+1G>A pathogenic variant is one of the most common variants reported in the B3GLCT gene and has been reported as c.1020+1G>A due to alternate nomenclature in the homozygous and compound heterozygous states in association with Peters plus syndrome (Lesnik Oberstein et al., 2006; Reis et al., 2008). In addition, in a study of 44 fetuses with prenatally diagnosed hydrocephaly, four of the fetuses also presenting with cleft lip/palate, agenesis of the corpus callosum, hypertelorism, eye anomalies, and brachydactyly were found to harbor the c.660+1G>A variant in the homozygous state (Schoner et al., 2013). This splice site variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 8 and leads to skipping of exon 8, as confirmed by RT-PCR studies (Lesnik Oberstein et al., 2006). The c.660+1G>A variant is observed in 154/126,284 (0.12%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.660+1G>A as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329095.7	B3GALTL	-

1264	Pathogenic	Nov 02, 2018	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 8 of the B3GLCT gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs80338851, ExAC 0.1%). This variant is the most common cause of Peters-plus syndrome, accounting for the majority of the alleles reported (PMID: 16909395, 18199743, 19796186, 23161355, 23213277, 23889335, 26684045). This variant is also known as c.1020+1G>A in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1264). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in B3GLCT are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 18798333, 23889335). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1264	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The B3GALTL c.660+1G>A variant occurs in a canonical splice site (donor) and is therefore predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product. The c.660+1G>A variant is well described in the literature and is the most frequently identified variant in individuals with Peters plus syndrome (PPS) (Saskia et al. 2014). Across a selection of literature, the c.660+1G>A variant was reported in a homozygous state in 24 patients and in a compound heterozygous state in 13 patients (Lesnik Oberstein et al. 2006; Reis et al. 2008; Dassie-Ajdid et al. 2009; Schoner et al. 2013; Weh et al. 2013). Parental testing was described in at least 15 sets of parent of affected patients, and the c.660+1G>A variant was identified in unaffected parents as expected based on their child's genotype. Hess et al.(2008) demonstrated that synthesis of the disaccharide Glc-Î²1,3-Fuc-O- is disrupted in patients with homozygous B3GALTL variants in contrast with their heterozygous relatives. The c.660+1G>A variant was not detected in 455 control chromosomes and is reported at a frequency of is 0.00104 in the non-Finnish European population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Based on the collective evidence and the potential impact of splice donor variants the c.660+1G>A variant is classified as pathogenic for Peters plus syndrome. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1270	Uncertain significance	Dec 09, 2019	This sequence change affects the initiator methionine of the GALNT12 mRNA. The next in-frame methionine is located at codon 65. While this variant is not present in population databases (rs267606839), the frequency information is unreliable, as metrics indicate poor data quality at this position in the ExAC database. This variant has been reported in an individual affected with colon cancer (PMID: 19617566). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1270). An experimental study has shown that this variant significantly reduces the protein expression and enzyme activity of the GALNT12 protein in transfected cells (PMID: 19617566). The current clinical and genetic evidence is not sufficient to establish whether loss-of-function variants in GALNT12 cause disease. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1273	Pathogenic	Dec 16, 2015	The p.Ala378fs variant in DOK7 has been reported in 17 individuals with congenit al myasthenia syndrome (CMS) with limb-girdle pattern of muscle weakness who wer e either homozygous or compound heterozygous for this variant (Beeson 2006 and L orenzoni 2013). It has been identified in 0.1% (28/24230) of Eurpoean chromosome s by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org), wh ich is consistent with a carrier frequency for this disease. In vitro functional studies also provide some evidence that the Ala378fs variant may impact protein function. This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, which alters the pro tein?s amino acid sequence beginning at position 378 and leads to a premature te rmination codon 30 amino acids downstream. Loss of function of the DOK7 gene is an established disease mechanism in individuals with CMS. In summary, this varia nt meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for CMS in an autosomal rec essive manner based upon its segregation in affected individuals and predicted i mpact on protein function.

1273	Pathogenic	Sep 06, 2018	The c.1124_1127dupTGCC pathogenic variant in the DOK7 gene has been reported previously in association with autosomal recessive congenital limb-girdle myasthenia, also known as congenital myasthenic syndrome type 1B (CMS1B), when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another pathogenic variant (Beeson et al., 2006; Selcen et al., 2008; Lorenzoni et al., 2013). The c.1124_1127dupTGCC variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Alanine 378, changes this amino acid to a Serine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 30 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Ala378SerfsX30. This variant results in protein truncation and loss of normal protein function (Beeson et al., 2006). We interpret c.1124_1127dupTGCC as a pathogenic variant.

1273	Pathogenic	Jan 08, 2020	This sequence change inserts 4 nucleotides in exon 7 of the DOK7 mRNA (c.1124_1127dupTGCC), causing a frameshift at codon 378. This creates a premature translational stop signal in the last exon of the DOK7 mRNA (p.Ala378Serfs*30). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 127 amino acids of the DOK7 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs764365793, ExAC 0.1%). This variant is one of the most commonly reported mutations among individuals affected with congenital myasthenic syndrome (PMID: 16917026, 20458068, 20012313, 22661499, 17452375, 18626973, 23790237, 23219351). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1273). Experimental studies have shown that this variant affects the phosphorylation of MuSK and also affects the ability of DOK7 protein to produce properly formed AChR clusters (PMID: 16917026, 2261499, 18165682, 18626973). Additionally, a knock-in mouse model of this variant showed severe muscle weakness (PMID: 25237101). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from pathogenic DOK7 variants in individuals affected with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) (PMID: 16917026, 17452375, 22661499, 19837590, Invitae).

These findings are consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. This variant has been reported in individuals in the Leiden Open-source Variation Database (PMID: 21520333). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1276).

1277	Pathogenic	Sep 26, 2017	The c.1143dupC pathogenic variant in the DOK7 gene has been reported previously using alternate nomenclature c.1143insC in multiple individuals with congenital myasthenia in the homozygous state as well as in the compound heterozygous state with other DOK7 variants (Beeson et al., 2006; Palace et al., 2007; Cossins et al., 2012). The c.1143dupC variant causes a frameshift starting with Glutamic acid at codon 382, changes this amino acid to an Arginine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 25 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Glu382ArgfsX25. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation as the last 123 amino acid residues are replaced by 24 aberrant residues. Functional studies in mouse myoblasts indicate that c.1143dupC disrupts protein function (Hamuro et al., 2008). The c.1143dupC variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016).

While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 45 amino acids of the DOK7 protein. The frequency data for this variant in the population databases is considered unreliable, as metrics indicate poor data quality at this position in the ExAC database. This variant has been observed in combination with another DOK7 variant in individuals affected with congenital myasthenic syndrome (PMID: 16917026, 18626973). This variant is also known as c,1378insC in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1282).

This variant segregated with disease in at least 2 affected famil y members. It was also identified in 0.02% (30/126708) of European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; db SNP rs139073416). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency . Furthermore, in vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Ala3 41Glu variant may impact protein function (Murakami 2012). In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, th e p.Ala341Glu variant is likely pathogenic for hyperphosphatasia-intellectual di sability syndrome inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM3_Strong, PM2_Supporting, PP1, PS3_Supporting (Richards 2015).

1284	Pathogenic	Jan 11, 2019	Across a selection of the literature, the PIGV c.1022C>A (p.Ala341Glu) missense variant was observed in a total of 17 individuals with hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome, including in nine in a homozygous state (three of whom were related) and in eight in a compound heterozygous state (two of whom were related). The p.Ala341Glu variant was absent from 350 controls and 4,000 exomes (Krawitz et al. 2010; Horn et al. 2011; Thompson et al. 2012; Horn et al. 2014). The variant is reported at a frequency of 0.000349 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Functional studies by Krawitz et al. (2010) showed that PIGV-deficient CHO cells transfected with wild type PIGV were able to restore surface expression of marker proteins, but that cells carrying the p.Ala341Glu variant were unable to restore expression. Murakami et al. (2012) produced similar results, and also demonstrated that expression of the p.Ala341Glu variant protein was drastically reduced as compared to wild type. The highest allele frequency reported in the Exome Sequencing Project is 0.00035 in the European American population. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ala341Glu variant is classified as pathogenic for hyperphosphatasia with intellectual disability syndrome. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1284	Pathogenic	Aug 25, 2016	The A341E variant is considered a mutational hotspot in the PIGV gene and has been reported multiple times previously in both the homozygous state and compound heterozygous state in patients with Mabry syndrome (Krawitz et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2012; Horn et al., 2014). Functional studies have demonstrated that the A341E variant results in decreased protein expression and protein destabilization (Krawitz et al., 2010; Murakami et al., 2012). The A341E variant was not observed at a significant frequency in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The A341E variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position where amino acids with similar properties to Alanine are tolerated across species. We interpret A341E as a pathogenic variant.

1300	Pathogenic	May 22, 2015	The p.Arg167X variant in DFNB59 has been reported in 2 individuals with hearing loss (1 Turkish and 1 Iranian), and segregated with disease in at least 1 affect ed family member (Collin 2007, Akhtarkhavari 2014). All affected individuals wer e homozygous. This variant has been identified in 9/65604 European chromosomes b y the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs118203989). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. Th is nonsense variant leads to a premature termination codon at position 167, whic h is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. In summary, this varian t meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for autosomal recessive sens orineural hearing loss (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based upon previous repor ts and the predicted impact of the variant.

1327	Uncertain significance	Mar 27, 2019	This sequence change replaces histidine with arginine at codon 147 of the CCT5 protein (p.His147Arg). The histidine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between histidine and arginine. This variant is present in population databases (rs118203986, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous in a family affected with autosomal recessive mutilating sensory neuropathy with spastic paraplegia (PMID: 16399879). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1327). This variant has been reported to have conflicting or insufficient data to determine the effect on CCT5 protein function (PMID: 25124038, 25345891, 28623285, 29552646). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1327	Likely pathogenic	Oct 06, 2016	The H147R variant in the CCT5 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in four brothers with mutilating sensory neuropathy and spastic paraplegia (Bouhouche et al., 2006). The H147R variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The H147R variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties.

1328	Pathogenic	Aug 09, 2018	The c.271dupT pathogenic variant in the BBS10 gene has been reported many times in association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)(Stoetzel et al., 2006). This variant is observed in the heterozygous state in 70/65,628 (0.1%) alleles from individuals of European background (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). The duplication causes a frameshift starting with codon Cysteine 91, changes this amino acid to a Leucine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 5 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Cys91LeufsX5. This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation, as the last 633 amino acids of the BBS10 protein are lost and replaced with 4 incorrect amino acids.

1328	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The BBS10 c.271dupT (p.Cys91LeufsTer5) variant results in a frameshift and is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Cys91LeufsTer5 is well-documented as a common founder mutation in several ethnic groups (Suspitsin et al. 2016). Stoetzel et al. (2006) sequenced 311 families with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and found the p.Cys91LeufsTer5 variant in 18 patients in a homozygous state, 13 in a compound heterozygous state, and five in a heterozygous state, accounting for 46% of variants detected. BBS is known to follow a complex inheritance pattern; several individuals were found in this study who also carried a third variant in one of the other genes known to be associated with BBS. The p.Cys91LeufsTer5 variant has also been identified in a homozygous state in affected individuals from two families, one of Indian descent and one of Northern European descent; in a compound heterozygous state in a 20 year old woman with BBS; and in three fetal cases (Putoux et al. 2010; Lindstrand et al. 2014; Sathya Priya et al. 2015). Control data are unavailable for this variant which is reported at a frequency of 0.00121 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Based on the evidence, the p.Cys91LeufsTer5 variant is classified as pathogenic for Bardet-Biedl syndrome. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1337	Pathogenic	Jun 14, 2018	The c.2991+1655 A>G variant is the most common LCA pathogenic variant in North America and North Western Europe, as it was identified in 16 out of 76 unrelated LCA1 patients (21%) (den Hollander et al., 2006), and has been observed in the homozygous state in many affected patients (Yzer et al., 2012). The variant is observed in 3/14960 (0.0201%) alleles from individuals of European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). Functional studies have shown that c.2991+1655 A>G results in the insertion of an aberrant exon into approximately half of CEP290 transcripts, and reduces CEP290 mRNA levels in comparison to wild type (Garanto et al., 2015; Gerard et al., 2012).

1337	Pathogenic	Dec 23, 2019	This sequence change falls in intron 26 of the CEP290 gene. It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the CEP290 protein. This variant is the most commonly reported CEP290 variant in individuals of European descent who are affected with Leber congenital amaurosis (PMID: 16909394, 17345604, 17964524). It is also known as IVS26+1655A>G in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1337). Experimental studies have shown that this variant creates a cryptic splice site in intron 26, resulting in the insertion of 128bp of intronic sequence between exons 26 and 27 (PMID: 16909394). This "pseudoexon" contains a stop codon, and results in decreased CEP20 protein expression. It has also been shown that if the pseudoexon is induced to be skipped, using antisense oligonucleotides, protein expression and cilia formation can be restored in cultured cells (PMID: 23344081). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1339	Pathogenic	May 15, 2017	The K1575X nonsense variant has been previously reported in individuals with Joubert syndrome, Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), and non-syndromic Leber congenital amaurosis, who all harbored a secondCEP290 variant on the other allele (Brancati et al., 2007, Perrault et al., 2007). Additionally, K1575X ishypothesized to represent a founder variant from France (Perrault et al., 2007). This variant ispredicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Therefore, we consider K1575X in CEP290 to be a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000567332.4	CEP290	-

1346	Likely pathogenic	Sep 23, 2016	The V239I variant in the VANGL1 gene has been reported previously in an individual with caudal regression with lipomyeloschisis, anorectal malformation, hydromyelia, and a tethered spinal cord. The V239I variant was also present in her unaffected mother and mildly affected brother who had dermal sinus (Kibar et al., 2007). The V239I variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The V239I variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies of V239I indicate that it inhibits the interaction of VANGL1 with Dvl proteins, potentially inhibiting molecular signaling during gastrulation and neural-tube closure (Kibar et al., 2007; Renolds et al., 2010). Based on review of the data in the context of the 2015 ACMG standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants (Richards et al., 2015), we now interpret V239I as a likely pathogenic variant.

1357	Pathogenic	Sep 11, 2018	The p.Trp204X variant in ALDH5A1 has been identified in homozygous state in 2 in dividuals and in compound heterozygous state in 5 individuals with succinic semi aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. It has also been identified in 11/ 126714 Eur opean chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broa dinstitute.org/; dbSNP rs118203982). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessiv e carrier frequency. This variant has been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID: 13 57). This nonsense variant leads to a premature termination codon at position 20 4, which is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Loss of function of the ALDH5A1 gene is an established disease mechanism in autosomal recessive succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. In summary, the p.Trp204X meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency in an autosomal recessive manner.

1357	Pathogenic	Apr 05, 2019	The ALDH5A1 c.612G>A (p.Trp204Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant and is predicted to result in premature truncation of the protein. The p.Trp204Ter variant has been reported in three studies in which it is found in a total of ten individuals with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, including in two who were homozygous for the variant, seven who carried the variant in a compound heterozygous state, and one who carried the variant in a heterozygous state where a second variant was not identified (Hogema et al. 2001; Akaboshi et al. 2003; Manrique Martin et al. 2018). The p.Trp204Ter variant was absent from 140 control chromosomes but is reported at a frequency of 0.000087 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. During prenatal evaluation of one fetus carrying the variant in a compound heterozygous state, 4-hydroxybutyric acid levels in the amniotic fluid were increased and SSADH activity was decreased in amniocytes and chorionic villi (Hogema et al. 2001). Based on the evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Trp204Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Therefore, R208X is considered to a pathogenic variant.

1376	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The TMEM67 c.622A>T (p.Arg208Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant and is predicted result in premature termination of the TMEM67 protein. Across a selection of available literature, the p.Arg208Ter variant has been identified in 12 patients with a phenotype of nephronophthisis, Joubert syndrome, or Meckel syndrome, including in a compound heterozygous state in nine patients and in a heterozygous state in three affected patients in whom a second variant was not identified, and in a heterozygous state in seven unaffected family members (Consugar et al. 2007; Khaddour et al. 2007; Otto et al. 2009; Halbritter et al. 2013). The p.Arg208Ter variant was absent from 388 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00024 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Based on the evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Arg208Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for TMEM67-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1376	Pathogenic	Mar 28, 2018	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal at codon 208 (p.Arg208*) of the TMEM67 gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. Loss-of-function variants in TMEM67 are known to be pathogenic. This particular variant has been reported in the literature in families and individuals affected with Joubert syndrome (PMID: 17397051, 21866095, 26092869), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (PMID: 17377820), and nephronophthisis-related cilopathies (PMID: 23559409). This gene is also known as MKS3 in the literature. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1377	Uncertain significance	Nov 23, 2018	The c.958 A>T variant is observed in 69/24,714 (0.3%) alleles from individuals of African background (Lek et al., 2016). Several in-silico splice prediction models predict that c.958 A>T creates a cryptic acceptor site which may supplant the natural acceptor site and lead to abnormal gene splicing. However, in the absence of RNA/functional studies, the actual effect of this sequence change in this individual is unknown. If c.958 A>T does not effect gene splicing, it will result in an S320C missense variant. The S320C variant has been previously reported to have occurred in cis with a TMEM67 G218A variant in an individual with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a complex multi-organ ciliopathy, who was also homozygous for the E1903X nonsense variant in the CEP290 gene (Leitch et al., 2008). Functional studies demonstrated that the S320C variant significantly impaired protein function (Leitch et al., 2008). The S320C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic variant or a rare benign variant.

1378	Likely pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The heterozygous p.Ile833Thr variant in TMEM67 was identified by our study in the compound heterozygous state, with a VUS, in one individual with Joubert syndrome. This variant has been reported pathogenic by OMIM in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1378) and has been identified in 0.007909% (10/126438) of European (non-Finnish) chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs267607119). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. The p.Ile833Thr variant in TMEM67 has been reported in 10 individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds (Egypt, Croatia, Belgium, Japan, Germany) with Joubert syndrome and segregated with disease in 2 affected relatives from 1 family (PMID: 26092869, 19058225, 21633164, 19508969). The presence of this variant in combination with 4 variants (all reported pathogenic by the literature/OMIM in ClinVar and 1 reported pathogenic in ClinVar by additional submitters) and in 4 individuals with Joubert syndrome increases the likelihood that the p.Ile833Thr variant is pathogenic. In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, this variant is likely pathogenic.

The isoleucine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between isoleucine and threonine. This variant is present in population databases (rs267607119, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been observed to segregate withÂ¬â€ Joubert syndromeÂ¬â€ in families (PMID: 19058225, 21866095) and has also been observed in individuals with Joubert syndrome (PMID: 19058225,Â¬â€ 21866095, 26092869, 28497568, 28973083). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1378). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

The C615R variant is observed in 29/66,714 (0.04%) alleles from individuals of European background (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). The C615R variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore, C615R is considered to be a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000567559.3	TMEM67	-
1383	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	Across a selection of available literature, the TMEM67 c.1843T>C (p.Cys615Arg) missense variant has been identified in a homozygous state in seven patients and in a compound heterozygous state in at least 11 patients with TMEM67-related disorders, which include the phenotypically overlapping disorders nephronophthisis, Joubert syndrome, and Meckel syndrome (Otto et al. 2009; Tallili et al. 2009; Gunay-Aygun et al. 2009; Seeman et al. 2010; Halbritter et al. 2013). The p.Cys615Arg variant was absent from 484 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00043 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies in cell lines demonstrated that the p.Cys615Arg variant prevents the localization of the protein to cilia and disrupts the ability of TMEM67 to regulate Wnt signaling (Gunay-Aygun et al. 2009; Abdelhamed et al. 2015). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Cys615Arg variant is classified as pathogenic for TMEM67-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1387	Pathogenic	Sep 17, 2015	The M252T variant has been reported previously in combination with the P82R variant or another variant in TMEM67 in individuals with Joubert syndrome (Chaki et al., 2011; Doherty et al., 2010). M252T has also been identified in combination with other TMEM67 missense or nonsense variants in individuals with Meckel syndrome (Chaki et al., 2011; Khaddour et al., 2007; Iannicelli et al., 2010). Additionally, this substitution has been reported in an individual with COACH syndrome who did not have a second identifiable variant in TMEM67 (Doherty et al., 2010). M252T was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution at a position that is conserved across species. Missense variants in nearby residues (G250R and M257V) have also been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with TMEM 67-related disorders (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. We therefore interpret M252T as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000515816.4	TMEM67	-

1391	Pathogenic	Dec 10, 2019	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 11 of the MKS1 gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs199874059, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been observed in combination with another MKS1 variant in an individual affected with Meckel-Gruber syndrome (PMID: 17377820). In at least one individual the data is consistent with the variant being in trans (on the opposite chromosome) from a pathogenic variant. This variant is also known as IVS11+1G>A in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1391) Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in MKS1 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 17397051). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1392	Pathogenic	Nov 27, 2017	This sequence change affects codon 139 of the MKS1 mRNA. It is a 'silent' change, meaning that it does not change the encoded amino acid sequence of the MKS1 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs386834048, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been reported to segregate with Meckel syndrome in a single family and has been found in several individuals affected with Meckel syndrome or Joubert syndrome (PMID: 17377820, 17397051, 26092869, 17437276, 26490104, 28497568). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1392). Experimental studies have shown that this silent change leads to skipping of exon 4 (PMID: 17377820). In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1392	Likely pathogenic	Jul 31, 2017	The p.Glu139Glu (NM_017777.3 c.417G>A) variant in MKS1 has been reported in 8 co mpound heterozygous individuals with Meckel syndrome and 1 compound heterozygous individual with Joubert syndrome (Consugar 2007, Khaddour 2007, Frank 2007, Tal lila 2009, Bachmann-Gagescu 2015). This variant is located in the last base of t he exon, which is part of the 5? splice region, and has been demonstrated to imp act splicing in patient cells (Consugar 2007). It has been identified in 31/126, 722 European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnom ad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs386834048, rs370514840). Although this variant ha s been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consist ent with a recessive carrier frequency. Biallelic loss of function of the MKS1 g ene is associated with Meckel syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In summary, the p. Glu139Glu variant is likely pathogenic for Meckel syndrome in an autosomal reces sive manner based on its occurrence in affected individuals and demonstrated imp act on splicing.

1392	Likely pathogenic	Oct 11, 2018	The MKS1 c.417G>A (p.Glu139Glu) variant has been reported in three studies in probands with Meckel syndrome (MKS) in which it is found in a total of four individuals, all in a compound heterozygous state with a second pathogenic variant (Consugar et al. 2007; Khaddour et al. 2007; Frank et al. 2007). The p.Glu139Glu variant was absent from 410 control chromosomes but is reported at a frequency of 0.000394 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the Genome Aggregation Database. The p.Glu139Glu variant is a synonymous variant that affects the last nucleotide of exon four and is predicted to destroy the splice donor site. RT-PCR and sequence analysis of proband fibroblasts showed a smaller abnormal band which when sequenced, confirmed that the variant results in skipping of exon 4 (Consugar et al. 2007). Aberrant splicing is a known mechanism in MKS. Based on the evidence, the p.Glu139Glu variant is classified as likely pathogenic for Meckel syndrome. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1411	Uncertain significance	Oct 23, 2018	The SPATA16 c.848G>A (p.Arg283Gln) variant is a missense variant that has been reported in a single study and is found in a homozygous state in three brothers from a consanguineous family affected with globozoospermia. Both the parents and two unaffected brothers were heterozygous for the variant (Dam et al. 2007). The p.Arg283Gln variant was absent from 231 control individuals and is reported at a frequency of 0.002856 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Three different splice-site prediction tools predicted the c.848G>A change to disrupt the splice site, and transfection of c.848G>A in COS1 or HeLa cells followed by RT-PCR showed aspecific mRNA products as a result of abnormal splicing. In addition, binding to the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SnRNP) was evaluated; while the wild type DNA was found to bind to U1 SnRNP, binding could not be detected for the c.848G>A variant (Dam et al. 2007). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated R284Q mutant mice, which corresponded with R283Q variant in human SPATA16, was not found to affect male fertility; however, deletion of the fourth exon of Spata16 resulted in infertile male mice due to spermiogenic arrest but not globozoospermia (Fujihara et al. 2017).

1417	Uncertain significance	Sep 07, 2017	The F1745C variant in the SI gene has been reported previously in at least three individuals with sucrase-isomaltase deficiency; one individual harbored a second missense variant in the SI gene, although the phase of these two variants was not determined, and two other individuals harbored F1745C with no second variant identified (Sander et al., 2006). Although not observed in the homozygous state, the F1745C variant is observed in 110/628054 (0.175%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). The F1745C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. We interpret F1745C as a variant of uncertain significance.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000616877.1	SI	-
1417	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The SI c.5234T>G (p.Phe1745Cys) missense variant has been identified in individuals with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), including in a compound heterozygous state in at least four individuals and in a heterozygous state in two individuals in whom a second variant was not identified (Sander et al. 2006; Lucke et al. 2009). Uhrich et al. (2012) identified the p.Phe1745Cys variant in five out of 31 individuals with CSID, or an allele frequency of 0.08. Control data is not available for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00209 in the European-American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Functional studies using COS cells transfected with wild type or variant SI plasmids demonstrated that the p.Phe1745Cys variant disrupts the trafficking of the SI protein out of the endoplasmic reticulum, and that the variant disrupts the folding and enzymatic activity of the essential sucrase domain of the SI protein (Alfalah et al. 2009). Based on the evidence, the p.Phe1745Cys variant is classified as pathogenic for congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1418	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The SI c.1730T>G (p.Val577Gly) missense variant is documented as one of the most common pathogenic variants found in individuals with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) (Gericke et al. 2016). The p.Val577Gly variant has been reported in two individual studies in which it is found in two siblings in a compound heterozygous state and in eight individual alleles of unspecified zygosity, which represented 15% of all individual alleles in the study (Sander et al. 2006; Uhrich et al. 2012). The p.Val577Gly variant was absent from the single control tested but is reported at a frequency of 0.00139 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. The Val577 residue is conserved. Functional studies performed by Alfalah et al. (2009) show that the p.Val577Gly variant results in a protein that is misfolded with a subsequent loss of enzyme activity. The variant protein was also shown to exist exclusively as a mannose-rich glycosylated species and to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on the evidence, the p.Val577Gly variant is classified as pathogenic for congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1418	Likely pathogenic	Apr 17, 2018	The V577G variant in the SI gene has previously been reported in the compound heterozygous state in two families with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (Sander et al., 2006; Haberman et al., 2017). In addition, V577G has been suggested as a possible predisposition factor for irritable bowel syndrome when seen in the heterozygous state with no second SI variant (HenstrÃ¶m et al., 2018). The V577G variant is observed in 419/270964 (0.15%) alleles including 1 homozygous individual in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The V577G variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. Functional studies demonstrated that V577G led to misfolding of the SI protein, preventing the protein from exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and resulting in loss of enzymatic function (Alfalah et al., 2009). We interpret V577G as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000567692.5	SI	-

In vitro functional studies of the p.Val577Gly v ariant report an impact to protein folding (Alfalah 2009). This variant has been identified in 0.2% (226/114,952) of European chromosomes by the Exome Aggregati on Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121912615). Althoug h this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low eno ugh to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, this varian t meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for congenital sucrase-is omaltase deficiency in an autosomal recessive manner based upon biallelic occurr ence in affected individuals, segregation data and functional evidence.

Uhrich et al. (2012) identified the p.Gly1073Asp variant on 17/62 CSID individual alleles and indicated that at least 11 individuals carried the variant in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state. Control data was not available for the p.Gly1073Asp variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00233 in the European-American population of the Exome Sequencing Project.

1419	Likely pathogenic	Jan 17, 2018	The p.Gly1073Asp (NM_001041.3 c.3218G>A) variant in SI has been reported in at l east 14 compound heterozygous or homozygous individuals with congenital sucrase- isomaltase deficiency, and segregated with disease in one affected sibling (Sand er 2006, UIhrich 2012, Opekun 2016). This variant has also been reported in Clin Var (Variation ID#1419). Enzymatic studies conducted on patient samples suggest that the p.Gly1073Asp variant confers absence of sucrase activity (Opekun 2016) and in vitro functional studies of the variant report an impact to protein foldi ng along with reduced activity (Alfalah 2009). This variant has been identified in 0.222% (280/125888) of European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Databas e (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121912616), though this fre quency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In sum mary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical s ignificance, the p.Gly1073Asp variant is likely pathogenic for sucrase-isomaltas e deficiency in an autosomal recessive manner based upon biallelic occurrence in affected individuals, segregation data and functional evidence.

1421	Pathogenic	Sep 12, 2016	Variant summary: The MMACHC c.271dupA (p.Arg91Lysfs) variant results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncated or absent MMACHC protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. This variant was found in 132/120196 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0010982, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MMACHC variant (0.0030542). The variant is a well known common disease variant and has been reported in numerous affected individuals in the literature, including individuals carrying the variant in the homozygous and compound heterozygous state (Lerner-Ellis_2006). Supporting the pathogenicity of this variant, incorporation of labelled methyltetrahydrofolate and propionate into cellular macromolecules was significantly affected in patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous c.271dupA (Lerner-Ellis_2006). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1421	Pathogenic	Dec 31, 2019	This sequence change inserts 1 nucleotide in exon 2 of the MMACHC mRNA (c.271dupA), causing a frameshift at codon 91. This creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Arg91Lysfs*14) and is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. Loss-of-function variants in MMACHC are known to be pathogenic. This particular variant is a well known cause of early onset cobalamin C deficiency in the literature (PMID: 16311595, 19760748, 20631720, 24599607, 25894566).

1421	Pathogenic	Sep 24, 2018	The c.271dupA pathogenic variant in the MMACHC gene has been reported previously in association with cblC deficiency (Lerner-Ellis, et al., 2006; Richard et al., 2009). In one large study of 204 patients with cblC deficiency, the c.271dupA variant accounted for 40% of all disease alleles (Lerner-Ellis, et al., 2006). The c.271dupA variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Arginine 91, changing it to Lysine, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 14 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Arg91LysfsX14. This variant is predicted to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or in protein truncation. Therefore, c.271dupA is interpreted to be a pathogenic variant.

1421	Pathogenic	Oct 26, 2017	The MMACHC c.271dupA (p.Arg91LysfsTer14) variant, also referred to as c.270_271insA, results in a frameshift variant and is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Arg91LysfsTer14 variant is well described in the literature and is reported as the most common pathogenic variant in the MMACHC gene accounting for approximately 40% of disease alleles (Manoli et al. 2016). The variant has been reported in at least 12 studies in which it was found in over 270 individuals with disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism, including at least 127 in a homozygous state and 143 in a compound heterozygous state (Lerner-Ellis et al. 2006; Morel et al. 2006; Heil et al. 2007; Nogueira et al. 2008; Lerner-Ellis et al. 2009; Perez et al. 2010; Frattini et al. 2010; Tsai et al. 2011; Komhoff et al. 2103; Gizicki et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2014; Collison et al. 2015). The variant was absent from 105 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00173 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Individuals who carry the p.Arg91LysfsTer14 variant in a homozygous state tend to have an earlier age of onset of the condition while the age of onset of disease when carried in the compound heterozygous state varies depending on the second variant (Morel et al. 2006). Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrated that the p.Arg91LysfsTer variant results in significantly lower levels of transcript compared to wild type. Based on the potential impact of frameshift variants and the supporting evidence from the literature, the p.Arg91LysfsTer14 variant is classified as pathogenic for disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

This frameshift variant is predicted to alter the protein’s amino acid sequence beginning at position 91 and lead to a premature termination codon 14 amino acids downstream. This alteration is then predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. In summary, this variant meets our criteria for pathogenicity.

R132X variant in the MMACHC gene has been reported previously in association with cblC deficiency (Lerner-Ellis, et al., 2006). The R132X variant accounts for approximately 8-20% of variants in the MMACHC gene, the range believed to reflect differences in population frequencies; it has been reported that many individuals with the R132X variant are of Middle Eastern origin (Lerner-Ellis et al., 2006, Lerner-Ellis et al., 2009). This variant is predicted to result in protein truncation.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000238989.13	MMACHC	-

1423	Pathogenic	Nov 25, 2019	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the MMACHC gene (p.Arg132*). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 151 amino acids of the MMACHC protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918241, ExAC 0.07%). This variant has been reported as homozygous or in combination with another MMACHC variant in several individuals affected with methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia of the cobalamin C (cblC) type (PMID: 16311595, 25511120, 26563984, 19760748 , 20631720, 24577983, 26149271) including the finding of the variant on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from a pathogenic variant. This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1423). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1424	Pathogenic	Oct 11, 2018	The R111X nonsense variant is a common variant that was identified on 36 of 204 alleles (17.6%) of patients with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cobalamin C type and is associated with early-onset disease when homozygous (Lerner-Ellis et al., 2006). The R111X variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We interpret R111X as a pathogenic variant.

1424	Pathogenic	Oct 06, 2016	Variant summary: The MMACHC c.331C>T (p.Arg111X) variant results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncated or absent MMACHC protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. One in vitro study showed mRNA leves in cell lines that are homozygotes for c.331C>T showed ~60% decrease compared to wild-type cell lines (Lerner-Ellis_2009), suggesting this nonsense variant leads to nonsense mediated mRNA decay. One in silico tool predicts a damaging outcome for this variant. This variant was found in 9/120818 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0000745, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MMACHC variant (0.0030542). This variant has been shown to be one of the most common pathogenic variant in CBLC patients and tend to lead to early onset type of disease. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant has been classified as pathogenic.

1424	Pathogenic	Mar 28, 2016	The p.Arg111X variant in MMACHC has been reported in at least 29 individuals (9 homozygotes and 20 compound heterozygotes) with methymalonic aciduria and homocy stinuria, cbIC type (Lerner-Ellis 2006). It has been associated with early onset disease (Lerner-Ellis 2006). This variant has been identified in 9/120714 chrom osomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org ; dbSNP rs121918242). Although this variant has been seen in the general populat ion, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequ ency. This nonsense variant leads to a premature termination codon at position 1 11, which is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Loss of functio n of the MMACHC gene is an established disease mechanism for methymalonic acidur ia. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic f or methymalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cbIC type based upon its co-occurre nce with disease-causing variants in affected individuals, low frequency in cont rol populations, and predicted functional impact.

1425	Pathogenic	Jan 25, 2018	The R161Q pathogenic variant in the MMACHC gene has been previously reported in association with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC type (Lerner-Ellis et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2007). This variant has been associated with a rare late-onset disease course with symptoms that resolved with hydroxycobalamin treatment (Wang et al., 2012). Functional studies found that R161Q is associated with reduced protein stability and dealkylation compared to wild type, and had reduced binding affinity to cyanocobalamin (Gherasim et al., 2015; Froese et al., 2009). In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. In summary, we interpret R161Q to be a pathogenic variant.

1425	Pathogenic	May 11, 2017	Variant summary: The MMACHC c.482G>A (p.Arg161Gln) variant causes a missense change involving the alteration of a highly conserved nucleotide. The variant alters a cobalamin binding site on conserved domain MMACHC-like (PM1). 3/4 in silico tools predict deleterious outcome for this variant (SNP&GO was not used due to a low reliability index). In the functional studies mutant R161Q has a decreased ability to bind incoming CNCbl, which results in a decreased ability to reductively decyanate the CNCbl to the cob(II)alamin form used in the metabolic pathway (PS3). The variant of interest has been identified in a large, broad control datasets of ExAC at a frequency of 0.000195 (18/120402 chrs tested), predominantly in individuals of Latino descent (0.0013; 15/16508chrs tesed). The observed frequencies are extremely low and do not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MMACHC variant (~0.0031) (PM2). The c.482G>A was identified heterozygously in an infant with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria without availability of segregation data and parental clinical information; this patient also tested positive for a known pathogenic mutation in the same gene (phase is unknown). The variant of interest was reported in compound heterozygosity in multiple affected individuals presenting with biochemically confirmed dx of late-onset methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria and proven segregation within the family (PM3, PP1, PP4). At least one case of early-onset presentation has been reported in 2.5 months old infant homozygous for the variant of interest. The codon Arg161 appears to be a mutational hot spot, as other alteration of the same codon, c.481C>G (p.Arg161Gly) (PM5) and c.481C>T (p.Arg161*) were identified in patients with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria. In addition, a clinical diagnostic laboratory/reputable database classified this variant as Pathogenic (PP5). Considering all evidence and ACMG guidelines, the variant was classified as Pathogenic.

1425	Pathogenic	Jul 25, 2017	The MMACHC c.482G>A, p.Arg161Gln variant (rs121918243) has been previously reported in individuals with late onset methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC type (Bodamer 2001, Collison 2015, Lerner-Ellis 2009, Liu 2010, Morel 2006, Rhamander 2014, Tsai 2007, Wang 2012). Functional characterization of the variant protein indicates lower thermostability compared to wild type and impaired binding and stabilization of vitamin B12 (Froese 2010, Gherasim 2015). The variant is listed as pathogenic in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1425), and observed in the general population databases at a frequency of 0.008 percent in the Exome Variant Server (1/12374 alleles), and 0.015 percent in the Genome Aggregation Database (41/277058 alleles). The arginine at residue 161 is highly conserved, and computational algorithms (Mutation Taster, PolyPhen-2, SIFT) predict that the variant has an impact on the protein. Based on the above information, the variant is classified as pathogenic.

1439	Uncertain significance	Dec 03, 2018	The heterozygous p.Asn228Ser variant in COQ2 was identified by our study in the compound heterozygous state, along with another VUS, in one individual with primary coenzyme q10 deficiency. The p.Asn228Ser variant in COQ2 has been reported in 1 Eastern European individual withprimary coenzyme q10 deficiency (PMID: 17855635), and has been identified in 0.02376% (30/126254) of European (non-Finnish) chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121918232). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. The presence of this variant in combination with a variant reported pathogenic by OMIM in ClinVar and in an individual with primary coenzyme q10 deficiency slightly increases the likelihood that the p.Asn228Ser variant is pathogenic (PMID: 17855635; Variation ID: 1438). Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, while there is some suspicion for a pathogenic role, the clinical significance of this variant is uncertain. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM2, PP3, PM3_Supporting (Richards 2015).

1439	Uncertain significance	May 22, 2017	The COQ2 c.683A>G (p.Asn228Ser) missense variant has been reported in a compound heterozygous state in two individuals with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency (Diomedi-Camassei et al. 2007; McCarthy et al. 2013). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which it is reported at a frequency of 0.00029 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Desbats et al. (2016) expressed the p.Asn228Ser variant in yeast cells to evaluate the effect on COQ2 activity. They indicate this variant is a mild variant. The evidence for the p.Asn228Ser variant is limited. It is therefore classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1440	Pathogenic	Oct 18, 2018	The COQ2 c.437G>A (p.Ser146Asn) missense variant has been reported in at least eight individuals with clinical features of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency, including in at least seven in a homozygous state, including two sibling pairs, and in one in a compound heterozygous state (Diomedi-Camassei et al. 2007; Dinwiddie et al. 2013; BujÃ¡n et al. 2014; Fragaki et al. 2016; Eroglu et al. 2018). The parents of one homozygous individuals were found to be heterozygous carriers of the variant (Diomedi-Camassei et al. 2007). The variant was also identified in a heterozygous state in one individual with multiple system atrophy with age of onset >50 years (Ogaki et al. 2014). The variant was absent from 860 controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00011 in the European (non-Finnish) population from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. In fibroblasts from an individual homozygous for the p.Ser146Asn variant, CoQ10 concentration was low and biosynthesis of CoQ10 was deficient in the presence of two different substrates (BujÃ¡n et al. 2014). In fibroblasts from another homozygous individual, multiple oxidative phosphorylation defects were noted (Rizza et al. 2009). In a yeast complementation assay, the p.Ser146Asn variant, referred to as p.Ser96Asn, showed low CoQ6 content compared to wildtype (Desbats et al. 2016). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ser146Asn variant is classified as pathogenic for primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1443	Pathogenic	Jun 05, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with histidine at codon 26 of the HMBS protein (p.Arg26His). The arginine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and histidine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed to be de novo in an individual affected with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) (PMID: 26095755) and to segregate with disease in several families (PMID: 8401516, 26582343). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1443). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change causes a drastic reduction in HMBS enzymatic activity (PMID: 9281416). Variants that disrupt the p.Arg26 amino acid residue in HMBS have been observed in affected individuals (PMID: 7757070, 19292878, 10502788, 16817012, 20978940, 24997713, 11831862, 18627369, 9199558). This suggests that it is a clinically significant residue, and that other variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.	MedGen:CN517202	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	Invitae	SCV000938479.2	HMBS	-

1446	Pathogenic	Mar 26, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with glutamine at codon 167 of the HMBS protein (p.Arg167Gln). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant is present in population databases (rs118204095, ExAC 0.04%). This variant has been observed in individuals affected with acute intermittent porphyria (PMID: 2243128, 7962538, 12372055, 15003823, 9199558) and in individuals from two families affected with this condition who also had another variant in the HBMS gene (PMID: 27558376, 1577472). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1446). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change abrogates HMBS enzyme activity and reduces enzyme stability (PMID: 27539938, 2243128, 12773194). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. The p.Arg167 amino acid residue in HMBS has been determined to be clinically significant (PMID: 27539938, 11055586, 15643298, 23815679, 15003823, 7962538, 12372055). This suggests that variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1446	Likely pathogenic	Sep 26, 2018	The R167Q variant in the HMBS gene has been reported previously in the heterozygous state in association with acute intermittent porphyria (Delfau et al., 1990). R167Q has also been reported in the compound heterozygous state with another HMBS variant in affected individuals from two families with spasticity, ataxia, neuropathy, and abnormal head imaging findings (Llewellyn et al., 1992; Kevelam et al., 2016). Functional studies demonstrate that the R167Q variant results in a dramatic reduction in enzymatic activity to approximately 1% of wild type levels (Delfau et al., 1990; Chen et al., 2016). The R167Q variant is observed in 8/72,186 (0.01%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The R167Q variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. We interpret R167Q as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000616739.2	HMBS	-

1456	Pathogenic	Jul 14, 2016	The R167W variant in the HMBS gene has been reported previously in the heterozygous state in multiple individuals with acute intermittent porphyria and reduced porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) activity (Gu et al., 1992; Bustad et al., 2013). R167W has also been reported in both the homozygous and compound heterozygous state in individuals with severe PBGD deficiency, elevated porphyrins and porphyrin precursors, severe psychomotor delays, neurological manifestations, and at least one individual was reported with congenital cataracts (Llewellyn et al., 1992; Solis et al., 2004). Functional studies indicate that the R167W substitution is a catalytic variant that affects enzyme kinetics, results in 1-5% of normal enzyme activity, and leads to an accumulation of porphyrin precursors (Bustad et al., 2013; Solis et al., 2004). The R167W variant was not observed in approximately 5500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R167W variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this substitution is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Missense variants in the same and a nearby Arginine residue (R167Q, R173W, R173G, and R173Q) have also been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with acute intermittent porphyria (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. We interpret R167W as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000577609.3	HMBS	-

1462	Pathogenic	Dec 18, 2018	The HMBS c.601C>T (p.Arg201Trp) missense variant has been reported in at least four studies in which it was found in a heterozygous state in at least 12 individuals with acute intermittent porphyria or hydroxymethylbilane synthase deficiency.(Lundin et al. 1994; Chen et al. 1994; Floderus et al. 2002; Cerbino et al. 2015). At least seven of these individuals were from one family in which the variant displayed segregation with disease (Lundin et al. 1994). Control data are unavailable for the p.Arg201Trp variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.000027 in the total population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Functional studies conducted in E. coli indicate the variant form of the protein exhibited reduced enzymatic activity and stability compared to the wild type (Chen et al. 1994). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg201Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for hydroxymethylbilane synthase deficiency.

1483	Pathogenic	Apr 30, 2015	The W283X variant in the HMBS gene has been reported previously in association with classic acuteintermittent porphyria (Chen et al., 1994). Functional studies demonstrated that the W283X mutant protein retains approximately 10% of the expressed normal activity and is as stable as the normal enzyme in vitro (Chen et al., 1994). The W283X variant is common in the Swiss population with nearly 60% of all acute intermittent porphyria patients harboring this founder variant which is thought to date back 1000 years (Schneider-Yin et al., 2002). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The W283X variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret W283X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000516944.3	HMBS	-

1483	Pathogenic	Nov 29, 2019	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Trp283*) in the HMBS gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed to segregate with acute intermittent porphyria in many families and reported in multiple unrelated individuals affected with this condition, being considered a founder mutation in the Swiss population (PMID: 12566739, 7962538). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1483). Experimental studies have shown that this nonsense change causes a significant reduction in HMBS enzyme activity (PMID: 7962538). Loss-of-function variants in HMBS are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 7757070, 7962538). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In summary, we interpret R148X to be a pathogenic variant.

1511	Pathogenic	Jun 14, 2016	The c.1529G>A (p.Arg510Gln) variant has been described as the most common pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency variant in the European population. Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Arg510Gln variant has been identified in at least 43 patients in a homozygous state, 21 patients in a compound heterozygous state, and one patient in a heterozygous state (Baronciani et al. 1993; Baronciani et al. 1995; Lenzner et al. 1997; van Solinge et al. 1997; van Wijk et al. 2003; Rider et al. 2011). Heterozygous parents of the patients, though not affected, were shown to have decreased levels of pyruvate kinase activity (van Solinge et al. 1997). The p.Arg510Gln variant was absent from 150 controls but is reported at a frequency of 0.00093 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Functional studies demonstrated that the variant has decreased thermostability, accelerated intracellular proteolytic degradation, and is more susceptible to ATP inhibition (Lenzner et al 1997; Wang et al. 2001). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg510Gln variant is classified as pathogenic for pyruvate kinase deficiency.

1511	Pathogenic	Dec 21, 2015	The R510Q pathogenic variant in the PKLR gene has been reported as the most common pathogenic variant association with pyruvate kinase deficiency in Northern European populations, seen in affected individuals who were homozygous or compound heterozygous for the R510Q variant (Lenzner et al., 1997; Baronciani et at., 1993). Functional studies showed the R510Q protein had deceased stability toward heat and was more susceptible to ATP inhibition, leading to enzyme instability and decreased enzyme levels in the cell (Wang et al., 2001). The R510Q variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R510Q variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. We interpret R510Q as a pathogenic variant.

1513	Likely pathogenic	Jan 27, 2016	The c.1456C>T (p.Arg486Trp) (NM_ 000298.5) missense variant has been reported in several unrelated individuals diagnosed with PK deficiency. These families have a well-documented clinical history of anemia (Zarza et al. 1998). Case-control studies have reported this variant as a common disease causing variant accounting for 9%-32% of diagnosed cases (Zarza et al., 1998; Zanella et al., 2001; Kedar et al., 2009). This variant has often been reported in trans with several pathogenic variants, and functional studies have shown that patients harboring this variant, in a compound heterozygous state, have reduced PK activity relative to normal controls (Zarza et al., 1998; Zanella et al., 2001; Valentini et al. 2002; Kedar et al., 2009). This c.1456C>T variant is reported at low frequency in the population databases (ESP = 0.291%; 1000 Genomes = 1%; ExAC = 0.298%), and multiple in silico algorithms predict this variant to have a deleterious effect (GERP = 4.85; CADD = 18.75; PolyPhen = 1; SIFT = 0). Therefore, this collective evidence supports the classification of the c.1456C>T (p.Arg486Trp) variant as a recessive Likely Pathogenic variant for PK deficiency.

1513	Likely pathogenic	Sep 06, 2017	The p.Arg486Trp variant in PKLR has been reported in >25 compound heterozygous i ndividual with pyruvate kinase deficiency (Zarza 1998, Manco 2000, Zanella 2001, Kedar 2009, Kager 2016, Jaouani 2017, Baronciani 1993). This variant has also b een reported in ClinVar (Variation ID#1513) as likely pathogenic by two laborato ries. Enzymatic studies suggest that the p.Arg486Trp variant may be a mild mutat ion with reduced activity (Zarza 1998, Zanella 2001, Valentini 2002, and Kedar 2 009). This variant has been identified in 0.294% (372/126444) of European chromo somes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.o rg; dbSNP rs116100695), though this frequency is low enough to be consistent wit h a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, although additional studies are req uired to fully establish its clinical significance, the p.Arg486Trp variant is l ikely pathogenic for pyruvate kinase deficiency in an autosomal recessive manner based upon biallelic occurrence in affected individuals and enzymatic studies.

1522	Pathogenic	Oct 20, 2017	The G215E variant in the LPL gene has been reported multiple times in association with autosomalrecessive LPL deficiency when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another diseasecausingvariant (Emi et al., 1990; Monsalve et al., 1990; Bordugo et al., 2014; Ooi et al., 2012).G215E has also been reported in the heterozygous state in association with hyperlipoproteinemia(Chokshi et al., 2014; Johansen et al., 2014; Rodrigues et al., 2016). Function studies have shown theG215E variant results in a complete loss of catalytic activity (Hata et al., 1992). In silico analysis isinconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the proteinstructure/function. We interpret G215E as a pathogenic variant.

1522	Pathogenic	Dec 31, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with glutamic acid at codon 215 of the LPL protein (p.Gly215Glu). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and glutamic acid. This variant is present in population databases (rs118204057, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with lipoprotein lipase deficiency (PMID: 22095987, 1969408, 28438574). This variant is also known as p.Gly188Glu in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1522). This variant has been reported to affect LPL protein function (PMID: 1400331, 29288010, 1969408). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.	MedGen:CN517202	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	Invitae	SCV000935254.2	LPL	-

1529	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	Across nine studies, the LPL c.662T>C (p.Ile221Thr) missense variant, which is also referred to as p.Ile194Thr, was identified in 18 subjects with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency or severe hypertriglyceridemia, including four homozygotes, six compound heterozygotes, and eight heterozygotes in whom a second variant was not identified, and in a heterozygous state in at least two unaffected family members of patients (Henderson et al. 1991; Dichek et al. 1991; Santer et al. 2005; Nierman et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007; Ooi et al. 2011; Rabacchi et al. 2015; Rodrigues et al. 2016; Tani et al. 2016). The variant was absent from 522 total control individuals in these studies. The variant is reported at a frequency of 0.00012 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project, but this is based on only one allele in a region of good sequencing coverage so the variant is presumed to be rare in the general population. Functional studies demonstrated that despite finding the variant protein in the culture medium, the variant protein had virtually no lipolytic activity. Further, the amount of intracellular variant LPL protein was found to be higher than wildtype and it is suggested that the variant protein may not be secreted appropriately (Henderson et al. 1991). These results were confirmed in studies by Dichek et al. (1991) and Fojo et al. (1992). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ile221Thr variant is classified as pathogenic for familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1530	Pathogenic	Jun 29, 2017	The R270H variant in the LPL gene has been reported previously in the homozygous and compound heterozygous states in individuals with LPL deficiency; note that R270H is referred to as R243H using alternate nomenclature by Gotoda et al. (Gotoda et al., 1991; Zahavi et al., 2013. Behar et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016). The R270H variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). The R270H variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies of R270H indicate that it leads to decreased levels of LPL mass in media and non-detectable enzymatic activity in transfected cells (Gotoda et al., 1991). Different missense variants in the same residue (R270C, R270L) have been previously reported in association with LPL deficiency; note that R270C is referred to as R243C using alternate nomenclature by Ma et al. (Ma et al., 1994; Murthy et al., 1996). We interpret R270H as a pathogenic variant.

1548	Pathogenic	Jan 03, 2020	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 270 of the LPL protein (p.Arg270Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs118204077, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed in several individuals with clinical features of lipoprotein lipase deficiency (PMID: 7906986, 25966443, 29153744). This variant is also known as p.Arg243Cys in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1548). This variant disrupts the p.Arg270 amino acid residue in LPL. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with LPL-related conditions (PMID: 7906986, 25966443, 1752947), suggesting that it is a clinically significant residue. As a result, variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

However, since familial combined hyperlipidemia is estimated with a prevalence of 1 in 100, we decided not taken the prevalance and homozygous number in the gnomAD database as a strong benign evidence. This variant also known as Asn291Ser in literatures, has been detected in 11.8% (20/169) of persons affected with familial combined hyperlipidemia (PMID: 8541837). Functional analyses reveal that Asn291Ser mutation in the LPL gene is associated with significantly reduced HDL levels and results in a significant decrease in LPL catalytic activity. Taken together, we interpret it as Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PS4, PS3.

1560	Pathogenic	Dec 27, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with histidine at codon 674 of the NAGLU protein (p.Arg674His). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and histidine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894590, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with MPS IIIB (PMID:Â¬â€ 8650226,Â¬â€ 9443875, 9950362, 20852935). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1560). This variant has been reported to affect NAGLU protein function (PMID: 9443878). This variant disrupts the p.Arg674 amino acid residue in NAGLU. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with NAGLU-related conditions (PMID:Â¬â€ 9443875, 10094189), suggesting that it is a clinically significant residue. As a result, variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

This variant is present in population databases (rs104894591, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with mucopolysaccharidosis (PMID: 9832037, 8650226, 10094189). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1561).

1562	Pathogenic	Nov 12, 2018	The R297X pathogenic variant in the NAGLU gene has been reported previously either in the homozygous state or in combination with another NAGLU variant in multiple unrelated individuals with MPS IIIB (Zhao et al., 1998; Yogalingam et al., 2000; Pollard et al., 2013; Meijer et al., 2016). Functional studies have shown that when R297X is expressed in CHO-K1 cells, only a truncated polypeptide that is rapidly degraded is observed, suggesting that the variant transcript undergoes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and no detectable enzyme activity is present (Yogalingam et al., 2000). The R297X variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret R297X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000568735.3	NAGLU	-
1562	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The NAGLU c.889C>T (p.Arg297Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant and has been reported in at least eight studies in which it is found in a total of 26 individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis, type III including three in a homozygous state, 20 in a compound heterozygous state, and three in a heterozygous state where the second allele was not identified (Zhao et al. 1996; Beesley et al. 1998; Weber et al. 1999; Yogalingham et al. 2000; Valstar et al. 2010; de Ruijter et al. 2012; Pollard et al. 2013; Welling et al. 2015). The p.Arg297Ter variant was absent from 80 control alleles but is reported at a frequency of 0.00002 in the Total population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies demonstrated that the variant resulted in very low levels of NAGLU enzyme activity and a 12-fold increase in glycosaminoglycan storage in individual fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts (Yogalingham et al. 2000). Due to the potential impact of stop-gained variants and the supporting evidence from the literature, the p.Agr297Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for mucopolysaccharidosis, type III. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1562	Pathogenic	Jun 25, 2018	Variant summary: NAGLU c.889C>T (p.Arg297X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. A truncation downstream of this position, c.1597C>T (p.Arg533X) has been classified as pathogenic by our laboratory. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 5.8e-05 in 277224 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in NAGLU causing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB (Sanfilippo Syndrome B) (5.8e-05 vs 0.0025), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.889C>T, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB (Sanfilippo Syndrome B)(Bunge_1999, Heron_2010). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. To our knowledge, no experimental evidence demonstrating an impact on protein function has been reported. Five ClinVar submissions from clinical diagnostic laboratories (evaluation after 2014) ctie the variant as "likely pathogenic/pathogenic." Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

The p.Arg565Trp variant has been reported in ten studies and is found in a total of 17 individuals including in four individuals in a homozygous state, in 11 individuals (including three sibling pairs) in a compound heterozygous state, and in two individuals in a heterozygous state (Beesley et al. 1998; Weber et al. 1999; Col et al. 2001; Tanaka et al. 2002; Lee-Chen et al. 2002; Beesley et al. 2005; Mangas et al. 2008; Valstar et al. 2010; Tang et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2014). The p.Arg565Trp variant was absent from 474 ethnically matched control chromosomes and is reported at a frequency of 0.00035 in the East Asian population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The p.Arg565Trp variant showed a drastic reduction in NAGLU enzyme activity despite normal mRNA levels in four studies (Lee-Chen et al. 2002; Mangas et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2014). Structural modelling showed that the p.Arg565Trp variant is located at the alpha-helical domain next to the enzyme binding site (Shi et al. 2014). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg565Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for mucopolysaccharidosis type III.

1586	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The NLRP7 c.2077C>T (p.Arg693Trp) variant is one of the most common variants found in recurrent hydatidiform mole (RHM). The variant has been reported in at least six studies in which it is found in nine affected individuals, including three in a homozygous state, three in a compound heterozygous state, and three of unknown zygosity (Murdoch et al. 2006; Puechberty et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Messaed et al. 2011; Dixon et al. 2012; Sebire et al. 2013). The p.Arg693Trp variant was absent from 1524 control chromosomes and is reported at a frequency of 0.00302 in the European (Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Co-immunoprecipitation studies with the p.Arg693Trp variant protein showed reduced dimer formation compared to wild type (Singer et al. 2014). The p.Arg693Trp variant protein was also found to be more potent at activating inflammasome complexes compared to wild type protein (Khare et al. 2012). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg693Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for recurrent hydatidiform mole. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1594	Likely pathogenic	Sep 17, 2018	The NDUFAF2 c.139C>T (p.Arg47Ter) variant, also known as c.182C>T (p.Arg45Ter), is a stop-gained variant predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The variant has been reported in two studies in which it is found in two individuals. Ogilvie et al. (2005) reported a proband with an atypical phenotype of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, who was a hemizygote for the c.139C>T (p.Arg47Ter) variant. The proband inherited the p.Arg47Ter variant from her unaffected mother, and inherited a deletion variant from her unaffected father. Helbig et al. (2016) identified the p.Arg47Ter variant in a homozygous state in one proband with epileptic encephalopathy. Control data are unavailable for the p.Arg47Ter variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.000265 in the East Asian population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Functional studies in proband fibroblasts demonstrated that wildtype NDUFAF2 transduction restored the complex I deficiency and activity to control levels, indicating the p.Arg47Ter variant was responsible for the proband's phenotype (Ogilvie et al. 2005). Based on the evidence, the p.Arg47Ter variant is classified as likely pathogenic for mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1594	Pathogenic	Feb 08, 2018	Variant summary: NDUFAF2 c.139C>T (p.Arg47X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. Truncations downstream of this position have been classified as pathogenic by our laboratory (e.g., p.Trp74X). The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.3e-05 in 276654 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in NDUFAF2 causing Leigh Syndrome (4.3e-05 vs 0.0013), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The c.139C>T variant has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Leigh Syndrome. This data indicates that the variant may be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence showing a lack of mature protein and no catalytic activity of the mitochondrial complex I (Ogilvie_2005). No clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

1596	Uncertain significance	Nov 26, 2019	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Arg284*) in the NLRP12 gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs104895564, ExAC 0.2%). This variant has been observed in a family with clinical features of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) (PMID: 18230725). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1596). This variant has been reported to have conflicting data to determine the effect on NLRP12 protein function (PMID: 18230725, 21360512). The current clinical and genetic evidence is not sufficient to establish whether loss-of-function variants in NLRP12 cause disease. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1612	Likely pathogenic	Oct 05, 2017	The H98R variant in the L2HGDH gene has been reported previously in the heterozygous state, in the presence of a second L2HGDH variant, and in the homozygous state, in multiple unrelated individuals with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, intellectual disability, and leukodystrophy (Vilarinho et al., 2005; Vilarinho et al., 2010). A different missense variant at the same residue, H98Y, has also been reported in the homozygous state in individuals with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (TopÃ§u et al., 2004; Haliloglu et al., 2008). The H98R variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The H98R variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. We interpret H98R as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000617755.2	L2HGDH	-

Although not present in the homozygous state, the R1445X variant is observed in 5/24020 (0.02%) alleles from individuals of African background, an in 13/277014 total alleles, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret R1445X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000680769.2	CUL7	-

This variant is only observed on five alleles in the Genome Aggregation Database, indicating it is not a common polymorphism. This variant abolishes the canonical splice donor site of intron 11, which is likely to disrupt gene function. Based on available information, the c.1182+1G>A variant is considered to be pathogenic.

The c.1182+1 G>A variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server).

1622	Pathogenic	Nov 26, 2018	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 11 of the ACADVL gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs113690956, ExAC 0.002%). This variant has been reported as homozygous or in combination with other ACADVL variants in individuals affected with VLCAD deficiency (PMID: 7479827, 27209629). This variant is also known as IVS11+1 in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1622). Experimental analyses of fibroblasts from an affected individual homozygous for this variant showed that it causes the in-frame skipping of exon 11 and results in a loss of VLCAD protein expression (PMID: 7479827). In addition, another individual heterozygous of this variant showed 50% residual VLCAD enzyme activity in lymphocytes (PMID: 21932095). In summary, this variant is a rare splice site change which has been reported in affected individuals with evidence of disrupting RNA splicing and protein function. For these reasons, it has been classified as Pathogenic.

1623	Pathogenic	Sep 20, 2018	The ACADVL c.1837C>T (p.Arg613Trp) variant has been reported in at least four studies and is found in a total of five probands with VLCAD deficiency including two in a homozygous state and three in a compound heterozygous state (Strauss et al. 1995; Gobin-Limballe et al. 2007; Laforet et al. 2009; Bouvier et al. 2017). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00014 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Analysis of proband fibroblasts reported by revealed significantly lower VLCAD enzyme activity and no detectable ACADVL protein (Hale et al. 1985; Strauss et al. 1995; Aoyama et al. 1995). Souri et al. (1996) reported the p.Arg613Trp variant protein expressed in CHO cells had significantly less protein accumulation when compared to wild type despite normal mRNA levels, reduced VLCAD activity, and failure to homodimerize. Further, Goetzman et al. (2007) used a bacterial expression system to confirm that the p.Arg613Trp variant protein has no VLCAD activity. Based on the evidence, the p.Arg613Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for VLCAD deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

In multiple affected patients, this variant was observed in trans to a second pathogenic variant (Gobin-Limballe 2007, Strauss 1995, Souri 1996). This variant is found in the general population with an overall allele frequency of 0.005% (14/282476 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database, and it is reported as pathogenic by multiple laboratories in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1623). The arginine at codon 613 is highly conserved and computational algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen2) predict this variant is deleterious. Additionally, several publications have shown that this variant results in reduced dimerization and enzyme function (Gobin-Limballe 2007, Goetzman 2007, Souri 1996). Taken together, the p.Arg613Trp variant is considered pathogenic. References: Gobin-Limballe S et al.

The c.343delG variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Glutamic Acid 115, changes this amino acid to a Lysine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 2 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Glu115LysfsX2. The c.343delG variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In summary, we interpret c.343delG as pathogenic.

1634	Pathogenic	Apr 23, 2018	The ACADVL c.1349G>A; p.Arg450His variant (rs118204016), also known as Arg410His for traditional nomenclature, is reported multiple times in the literature in association with VLCAD deficiency and is reported both in the homozygous and compound heterozygous states in affected individuals (Andresen 1999, Fukao 2001, Gobin-Limballe 2010, Kang 2018, Ohashi 2004, Smelt 1998, Zhang 2014). Additionally, functional analyses of the variant protein show decreased expression and enzymatic activity (Fukao 2001, Smelt 1998). This variant is reported in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1634) and found in the general population with a low overall allele frequency of 0.003% (8/277108 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database. The arginine at codon 450 is highly conserved, and computational analyses (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) predict that this variant is deleterious. Based on available information, this variant is considered to be pathogenic. REFERENCES Andresen BS et al.

1640	Pathogenic	Nov 12, 2019	NM_000382.2(ALDH3A2):c.943C>T(P315S) is classified as pathogenic in the context of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. Sources cited for classification include the following: PMID 10384396, 9254849, 9204959, 10577908, 9467812 and 11408337. Classification of NM_000382.2(ALDH3A2):c.943C>T(P315S) is based on the following criteria: This is a well-established pathogenic variant in the literature that has been observed more frequently in patients with clinical diagnoses than in healthy populations.

1640	Pathogenic	Dec 24, 2019	This sequence change replaces proline with serine at codon 315 of the ALDH3A2 protein (p.Pro315Ser). The proline residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs72547571, ExAC 0.03%). This variant is a known common cause of Sj gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) among individuals originating from the northern part of Sweden (PMID: 9254849). This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another ALDH3A2 variant in unrelated individuals with SLS and to segregate with disease in families (PMID: 11408337, 19124283, 10384396, 9204959). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1640). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1640	Pathogenic	Oct 04, 2016	P315S has been reported previously in association with SjÃ¶gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) and is a common pathogenic variant among individuals of northern European and Swedish ancestry (De Laurenzi et al., 1997).

1640	Pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The homozygous p.Pro315Ser variant in ALDH3A2 was identified by our study in one individual with Sjoegren-Larsson syndrome. The p.Pro315Ser variant in ALDH3A2 has been reported in 41 Northern European individuals with Sjoegren-Larsson syndrome, segregated with disease in 2 affected relatives from 1 families (PMID: 9204959, 9254849, 10577908), and has been identified in 0.02132% (27/126636) of European (non-Finnish) chromosomes and 0.003880% (1/25772) of European (Finnish) chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs72547571). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. The prevalence of the variant in affected Northern European individuals and data from large population studies suggests this is a founder variant with a higher prevalence than the prevalence of the variant in a control population (PMID: 9254849). Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. The presence of this variant in combination with a reported likely pathogenic variant and in an individual with Sjoegren-Larsson syndrome increases the likelihood that the p.Pro315Ser variant is pathogenic (PMID: 10577908; Variation ID: 1643). Functional expression studies with baculovirus and mammalian ovary cells provide some evidence that the p.Pro315Ser variant may impact protein function (PMID: 9204959, 10577908). However, these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. This variant has also been reported pathogenic in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1640). In summary, the p.Pro315Ser variant is pathogenic based off of our findings, multiple reports in ClinVar, and the literature.

1640	Pathogenic	Dec 17, 2018	Variant summary: ALDH3A2 c.943C>T (p.Pro315Ser) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Aldehyde dehydrogenase domain of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.0001 in 277112 control chromosomes (gnomAD). The variant, c.943C>T, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome, in particular in populations of Northern European descent (DeLaurenzi_1997). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity (DeLaurenzi_1997). Two clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.3e-05 in 277238 control chromosomes (gnomAD). c.1297_1298delGA has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome (Gloerich_2006, Rizzo_2010) and patients were found to have significantly reduced FADH activity (<10%; Gloerich_2006). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. Two ClinVar submissions from clinical diagnostic laboratories (evaluation after 2014) cites the variant as likely pathogenic/pathogenic.

1641	Pathogenic	Nov 30, 2019	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Glu433Argfs*3) in the ALDH3A2 gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs756844187, ExAC 0.004%). This variant has been reported to segregate with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) in many individuals (PMID: 9250352, 20049467, 16996289). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1641). Loss-of-function variants in ALDH3A2 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 10577908, 10854114).

1641	Pathogenic	Jan 15, 2019	The c.1297_1298delGA variant in the ALDH3A2 gene has been reported previously as the most common pathogenic variant observed among SjÃ¶gren-Larsson syndrome patients of European heritage (Tsukamoto et al., 1997; Ijlst et al., 1999; Rizzo et al., 2005). This variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Glutamic acid 433, changes this amino acid to an Arginine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 3 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Glu433ArgfsX3. The c.1297_1298delGA variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and is associated with <1% residual enzyme activity (Rizzo et al., 2005). This variant is observed in 9/126,722 alleles (0.007%) from individuals of non-Finnish European background, with no homozygous control individuals reported, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.1297_1298delGA as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000490399.2	ALDH3A2	-

1643	Likely pathogenic	Jun 14, 2016	The K266N variant in the ALDH3A2 gene has been reported previously in patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) (Rizzo et al., 1999; Willemsen et al., 2001). It was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. K266N is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved and in silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. However, several splice prediction models predict that this variant destroys the natural splice donor site in intron 5. Therefore, the K266N variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic variant, however the possibility it may be a rare benign variant cannot be excluded.

Based on the evidence, the p.Arg107His variant is classified as likely pathogenic for vitamin D-dependent rickets. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1664	Pathogenic	Feb 13, 2018	The c.262delG variant in the CYP27B1 gene is a common recurring hotspot deletion that has been reported previously in association with vitamin D-dependent rickets (VDDR type 1; also known as pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets and vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase deficiency). VDDR type 1 is particularly common in the Charlevoix-Saguenay-Lac Saint Jean area of Quebec, Canada where the population carrier frequency is estimated to be 1 in 26 (De Braekeleer et al., 1991). In one report, five out of six VDDR type 1 patients in a French Canadian group were homozygous for this variant (Wang et al., 1998). The c.262delG variant was not observed in approximately 6,200 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Valine 88, changes this amino acid to a Tryptophan residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 71 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Val88TrpfsX71. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

1669	Likely pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The CYP27B1 c.1166G>A (p.Arg389His) missense variant has been reported in at least four studies in which it is found in a compound heterozygous state in five patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets (Wang et al. 1998; Wang et al. 2002; Yan et al. 2011; Durmaz et al. 2012). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00024 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies in mouse testicular Leydig MA-10 cells revealed the variant resulted in no detectable 1-Î±-hydroxylase activity (Wang et al. 1998). Three other variants resulting in the abolition of enzyme activity are also found at the Arg389 residue (Sawada et al. 2001). Based on the evidence, the p.Arg389His variant is classified as likely pathogenic for vitamin D-dependent rickets. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1669	Pathogenic	Nov 07, 2018	The R389H variant in the CYP27B1 gene has been reported previously in vitamin D-dependent rickets, in affected individuals who were compound heterozygous for the R389H variant and another variant (Wang et al., 1998; Durmaz et al., 2012). The R389H variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). The R389H variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies demonstrate that the R389H variant has no detectable 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity (Wang et al., 1998). We interpret R389H as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000564924.3	CYP27B1	-

1683	Pathogenic	Aug 20, 2018	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Tyr485Cysfs*27) in the MANBA gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported as homozygous in an individual affected with beta-mannosidosis (PMID: 12468273). It is also known as 1541delAT in the literature. Loss-of-function variants in MANBA are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 9384606, 12468273). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1685	Pathogenic	Mar 02, 2017	Variant summary: The MAN2B1 c.2278C>T (p.Arg760X) variant results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncated or absent MAN2B1 protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. The variant of interest was observed in the large, broad control population, ExAC, with an allele frequency of 2/108116 (1/54058), which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic MAN2B1 variant of 1/632. A publication, Godota_1998, cites the variant in a sibling pair, where both sisters were homozygous for the variant. Authors indicate that the variant causes a Lysosomal alpha-mannosidosis type 2, with a milder phenotype, hypothesized by "The nonsense mutation in the alpha-mannosidase gene is located in exon 19, at a point ~75% along the length of the protein. This nonsense mutation likely encodes an unstable mRNA, such that a relatively stable but defective protein is produced that can show partial activity toward alpha-mannose residues in vivo." In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as likely pathogenic/pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1687	Pathogenic	Aug 16, 2017	The MAN2B1 c.2248C>T (p.Arg750Trp) missense variant is one of the most frequently reported variants among individuals with alpha-mannosidosis from European populations and generally accounts for more than 27% of all disease alleles in studied cohorts (Malm et al. 2001; Riise Stensland et al. 2012; Borgwardt et al. 2015). Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Arg750Trp variant has been identified in at least 50 individuals with alpha-mannosidosis, including 22 individuals in a homozygous state and 28 individuals in a compound heterozygous state (Gotoda et al. 1998; Berg et al. 1999; Riise Stensland et al. 2012; Borgwardt et al. 2015). The p.Arg750Trp variant was absent from at least 236 control alleles but is reported at a frequency of 0.001361 in the European (Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The activity of alpha mannosidase in fibroblasts of two unrelated patients has been reported to demonstrate two percent activity of normal (Gotoda et al. 1998). Nearly absent enzyme activity due to misfolded protein arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum as inactive single-chain forms has been demonstrated in COS1 and COS7 cells transfected with the p.Arg750Trp variant (Gotoda et al. 1998; Hansen et al. 2004). The p.Arg750Trp variant has been used as a negative control for functional analysis of novel MAN2B1 variants (Borgwardt et al. 2015). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg750Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for alpha-mannosidosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1687	Pathogenic	May 26, 2017	Variant summary: The MAN2B1 c.2248C>T (p.Arg750Trp) variant involves the alteration of a non-conserved nucleotide. 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant (SNPsandGO not captured due to low reliability index). This variant was found in 28/121552 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0002304, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MAN2B1 variant (0.0015811). The variant has been reported in numerous affected individuals in the literature, both in the homozgyous and compound heterozygous state. Additionally, a functional study showed that the variant protein was misfolded and arrested in the ER as inactive single-chain form, and patients and transfected cell lines both had almost no detectable enzyme activity (Gotoda_1998, Hansen_2004). Multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1701	Pathogenic	Jan 23, 2018	The R735X variant in the ERCC6 gene has been reported previously in association with Cockayne syndrome, when present in the homozygous state or heterozygous with another disease-causing variant (Mallery et al., 1998). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The R735X variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). We interpret R735X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000617667.2	ERCC6	-

This variant is present in population databases (rs121917901, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed in individuals affected with Cockayne syndrome (PMID: 9443879). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1701). Loss-of-function variants in ERCC6 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 9443879, 18628313).

1701	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The ERCC6 c.2203C>T (p.Arg735Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant predicted to result in permature termination of the protein. The p.Arg735Ter variant has been reported in at least three studies in which it is found in a total of five patients, including one homozygote and two compound heterozygotes with Cockayne syndrome, and two homozygotes with de Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome (Mallery et al. 1998; Colella et al. 2000; Laugel et al. 2010). Control data are unavailable for this variant which is reported at a frequency of 0.00015 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Functional studies using primary fibroblast cell lines derived from patients with the p.Arg735Ter variant showed that the variant was associated with defective telomere maintenance as well as increased reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial oxidative stress but was not associated with nuclear DNA damage (Batenburg et al. 2012; Cleaver et al. 2014). Functional studies of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from skin fibroblasts carrying the p.Arg735Ter variant also showed that the lack of functional CSB protein caused by the variant did not prevent genetic reprogramming but did increase cell death and reactive oxygen species production (Andrade et al. 2012). Further, in a telomerase-immortalized cell line carrying the p.Arg375Ter variant in a homozygous state, addition of wild type CSB showed a significant decrease in the amount of cells with IR-induced 53BP1 foci and a significantly increased amount of cells with cyclin A and IR-induced foci of BRCA1, RPA, and Rad51, suggesting there is defective homologous recombination-mediated double strand break repair (Batenburg et al. 2015). Based on the collective evidence and the potential impact of stop-gained variants, the p.Arg275Ter variant is classified as pathogenic for ERCC6-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1711	Likely pathogenic	Jul 24, 2017	The ERCC6 c.2047C>T (p.Arg683Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Arg683Ter variant been reported in two studies in which it is found in two patients including one homozygote with cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome (CFSS) and one compound heterozygote with Cockayne syndrome (Laugel et al. 2008; Calmels et al. 2016). Control data are not available for the p.Arg683Ter variant which is reported at a frequency of 0.00005 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the variant resulted in an absence of protein. Complementation assays in CFSS patient fibroblasts transfected with wild type ERCC6 demonstrated rescue of DNA repair deficiency (Laugel et al. 2008). Although the p.Arg683Ter variant is described in the literature in association with autosomal recessive inheritance, an increased risk for macular degeneration due to heterozygous variants may exist. Due to the potential impact of stop-gained variants and evidence from the literature, the p.Arg683Ter variant is classified as likely pathogenic for ERCC6-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1717	Likely pathogenic	Aug 29, 2016	The A160V variant in the ERCC8 gene has been reported previously in the heterozygous state with a second pathogenic variant in a patient with Cockayne syndrome. However, parental studies were not available to determine if these variants were present on different alleles (in trans) in this patient (Ridley et al., 2005). The A160V variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The A160V variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. However, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. At the transcript level, this variant was shown to cause a deletion of exon 5 (Ridley et al., 2005; Nardo et al., 2009). Additional functional studies showed that A160V leads to no expression of ERCC8 protein (Ridley et al., 2005). The A160V variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic variant, however the possibility it may be a rare benign variant cannot be excluded.

1721	Pathogenic	Nov 01, 2018	The I41T pathogenic variant in the FIG4 gene has been reported previously in association with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (CMT4J) in individuals with a second FIG4 pathogenic variant on the other allele (Chow et al., 2007; Cottenie et al., 2013; Menezes et al., 2014). Functional studies have shown that the I41T mutant protein is unstable, resulting in low levels of FIG4 protein (Lenk et al., 2011). Additionally, this pathogenic variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution at a position that is conserved across species. The I41T variant is observed in 239/126,554 (0.2%) alleles from individuals of European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). Therefore, we interpreted I41T as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000278978.10	FIG4	-
1721	Pathogenic	Oct 25, 2018	The FIG4 c.122T>C (p.Ile41Thr) missense variant has been reported in four studies in which it is found in a total of 36 individuals with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, type 4, including in 18 in a compound heterozygous state, all in combination with a null variant, and in 18 in a heterozygous state in whom the second variant has not been found (Chow et al. 2007; Nicholson et al. 2011; Cottenie et al. 2013; Menezes et al. 2014). The p.Ile41Thr variant was found in 13 of 6064 controls, and is reported at a frequency of 0.001889 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Functional studies in proband fibroblasts, cultured cells, and yeast demonstrated that the p.Ile41Thr variant leads to low levels of protein due to impaired interaction with the scaffold protein, VAC14, which stabilizes FIG4 and impairs kinase activation (Chow et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2008; Ikonomov et al. 2010; Lenk et al. 2011). In a mouse model, overexpression (5-fold) of variant p.Ile41Thr in Fig4-null mice rescued the severe neurodegenerative phenotype and lethality, whereas lesser overexpression (2-fold) resulted in partial rescue and a CMT-like phenotype (Lenk et al. 2011). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ile41Thr variant is classified as pathogenic for Charcot-Marie-Tooth, type 4.

This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1721). Multiple experimental studies have shown that this missense change is deleterious (PMID: 17572665, 20630877, 21655088). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1723	Pathogenic	Aug 15, 2019	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Arg183*) in the FIG4 gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs121908288, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been reported in combination with another FIG4 variant in two siblings affected with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4 (PMID: 17572665) and in an individual affected with amyotropic lateral sclerosis (PMID: 19118816). This variant is also known as c.718C>T in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1723). Loss-of-function variants in FIG4 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 23623387). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1729	Pathogenic	Oct 02, 2018	The R145X variant in the NIPAL4 gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state in three patients with congenital ichthyosis (Lefevre et al., 2004). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Additionally, the R145X variant was not observed in approximately 6,100 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret R145X as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000513262.4	NIPAL4	-

1731	Pathogenic	Dec 10, 2018	The A176D variant is the most prevalent, recurrent pathogenic variant in the NIPAL4 gene. It has been reported homozygous or together with another pathogenic variant in numerous patients with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) from different population groups (Lefevre et al., 2004; Dahlqvist et al, 2007; Wajid et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Kiristi et al., 2015). Consistent with the high prevalence of NIPAL4-related congenital ichthyosis, and this variant in particular, the A176D variant is observed in 138/123,380 alleles (0.11%) from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts with no homozygous control individuals reported (Lek et al., 2016). The A176D variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. We therefore interpret A176D as a pathogenic variant.

1731	Pathogenic	Aug 31, 2017	The NIPAL4 c.527C>A (p.Ala176Asp) missense variant has been described as one of the two most common pathogenic variants for congenital ichthyosis, together accounting for up to 90% of disease alleles (Richard et al. 2014). Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Ala176Asp variant has been identified in a homozygous state in 45 patients and in a compound heterozygous state in eight patients (Lefevre et al. 2004; Dahlqvist et al. 2007; Wajid et al. 2010; Li et al. 2012; Palamar et al. 2015; Kiritsi et al. 2015; Diociaiuti et al. 2016). Up to 60% of individuals were born as collodion babies and most had clinical phenotypes consistent with lamellar ichthyosis or nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. The p.Ala176Asp variant was absent from 300 control chromosomes but is reported at a frequency of 0.0019 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Epidermal expression of the ichthyin protein in skin biopsies from healthy individuals showed the enzyme predominantly expressed in the upper epidermis, while expression in individuals homozygous for the p.Ala176Asp variant showed protein in the cell periphery and cytoplasm (Li et al. 2012). Based on the evidence p.Ala176Asp variant is classified as pathogenic for congenital ichthyosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1746	Uncertain significance	Mar 30, 2018	This sequence change replaces serine with leucine at codon 46 of the GIF protein (p.Ser46Leu). The serine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between serine and leucine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121434322, ExAC 0.07%). This variant has been reported as homozygous in individuals affected with intrinsic factor deficiency (PMID:Â¬â€ 22929189).Â¬â€ ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1746). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1746	Likely pathogenic	Nov 06, 2018	The p.Ser46Leu variant in GIF has been reported in 1 compound heterozygous and 2 homozygous individuals with congenital intrinsic factor deficiency and segregat ed with disease in 3 affected relatives from 1 family (Tanner 2005, Tanner 2012) . The p.Ser46Leu variant has been identified in 0.1% (34/35436) of Latino chromo somes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.o rg). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that the p .Ser46Leu variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predict ive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, although additional studies a re required to fully establish its clinical significance, the p.Ser46Leu variant is likely pathogenic.

1750	Pathogenic	Oct 11, 2018	The c.339+2T>C variant in the DBH gene has been reported previously in association with norepinephrine or dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (Kim et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2011; Arnold et al., 2017). This splice site substitution destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 1. It is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or to an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation. Early functional studies demonstrated that this variant results in aberrant mRNA processing and generates a transcript containing a premature stop codon as well as a normal transcript (Kim et al., 2002). Subsequent functional studies showed that this variant results in a non-detectable level of DBH protein (Kim et al., 2011). The c.339+2T>C variant is observed in 156/123,560 alleles (0.13%) from individuals of non-Finnish European background, and 201/264,450 global alleles (0.076%) with no homozygous control individuals reported, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.339+2T>C as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000567012.4	DBH	-
1750	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The DBH c.339+2T>C variant, also referred to as IVS1+2T>C, occurs in a canonical splice site (donor) and is therefore predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product. Across five studies, this variant is reported in a total of 11 dopamine beta-hydroxylas (DBH) deficiency patients, including two homozygotes and nine compound heterozygotes (Kim et al. 2002; Zabetian et al. 2003; Deinum et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2011; Jepma et al. 2011). The variant was also found in a heterozygous state in ten unaffected individuals and family members of patients. The c.339+2T>C variant was reported in a heterozygous state in one of 989 total controls and is reported at a frequency of 0.00128 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. RT-PCR analysis of the variant mRNA expressed in COS-7 cells showed that the c.339+2T>C variant caused aberrant splicing that resulted in a transcript that included intronic sequence and a premature termination codon (Kim et al. 2002). Additionally, Kim et al. (2011) demonstrated that expression of the c.339+2T>C variant in CHO cells showed no detectable DBH protein. Based on the collective evidence, the c.339+2T>C variant is classified as pathogenic for dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1750	Pathogenic	Sep 13, 2018	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 1 of the DBH gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs74853476, ExAC 0.1%). This variant has been reported to segregate with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency in several families (PMID: 11857564, 21209083, 15060114, 27778639). This variant is also known as IVS1+2T>C. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1750). Experimental studies have shown that this change results in abnormal mRNA splicing and produces a transcript containing a premature termination codon, resulting in non-detectable DBH expression (PMID: 21209083, 11857564). Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in DBH are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 11857564, 15060114). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1750	Pathogenic	Sep 30, 2014	The 339+2T>C variant in DBH has been previously reported in 1 homozygous and 5 compound heterozygous individuals with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency and was found to segregate with disease in 2 affected compound heterozygous relatives (Kim 2002, Denium 2004, Kim 2011, ). This variant has been identified in 0.128% (11/8600) of European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs74853476). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. This variant occurs in the invariant region (+/- 1,2) of the splice consensus sequence and in vitro splicing assays suggest it causes altered splicing leading to an absent protein (Kim 2011); however, these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency in an autosomal recessive manner (http://pcpgmwww.partners.org/personalizedmedicince/LMM ) based upon segregation studies and functional evidence.

1753	Pathogenic	Jul 24, 2018	This sequence change replaces proline with leucine at codon 622 of the MSH2 protein (p.Pro622Leu). The proline residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between proline and leucine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed to segregate with Lynch syndrome in families (PMID: 8261515, 16616355) and has also been found in several other individuals affected with this condition (PMID: 16116158, 25117503, 22283331). This variant is also known as 1933C>_x0001_T (P622L) in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1753). Numerous experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts MSH2 stability, blocking its interaction with binding partners and suppressing mismatch repair activity (PMID: 17720936, 12124176, 18822302, 21309037, 22102614, 24362816). Additionally, this variant has been determined to have a high probability of being pathogenic based on multifactorial likelihood analyses that used genetic, functional and in silico data (PMID: 22949379, 19267393). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1753	Pathogenic	Nov 03, 2017	Variant summary: The MSH2 c.1865C>T (p.Pro622Leu) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide located in the DNA mismatch repair protein MutS, core domain (IPR007696) (InterPro). 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant (SNPsandGO not captured due to low reliability index). A yeast functional study showed 4% MMR activity associated with this variant (Gammie_2007). This variant is absent in 246248 control chromosomes in gnomAD. This variant was reported in multiple patients with LS and it showed perfect segregation with disease in affected families (Arnold_2009, Leach_1993). In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1755	Pathogenic	Jan 07, 2019	This pathogenic variant is denoted MSH2 c.1216C>T at the cDNA level and p.Arg406Ter (R406X) at the protein level. The substitution creates a nonsense variant, which changes an Arginine to a premature stop codon (CGA>TGA), and is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through either protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This variant has been reported in multiple individuals with a personal and/or family history of Lynch-associated cancers, including those with absent MSH2 protein on tumor immunohistochemistry (Leach 1993, Kuismanen 2000, Kurzawski 2002, Casey 2005, Lagerstedt Robinson 2007, Grindedal 2009, Pastrello 2011, De Lellis 2013, Bashyam 2014, Ponti 2016, Vargas-Parra 2017).

1757	Pathogenic	Jul 12, 2018	Variant summary: MSH2 c.1786_1788delAAT (p.Asn596del) results in an in-frame deletion that is predicted to remove one amino acid from the encoded protein. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.1e-06 in 246242 control chromosomes (gnomAD). The variant, c.1786_1788delAAT, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Lynch Syndrome (Moslein_1996, Katballe_2002, Bonadona_2011, Stormorken_2005, Sunga_2017). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function (Heinen_2003, Drost_2011, Heinen_2002). The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity (Stormorken_2005). Six clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. All laboratories classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

1757	Pathogenic	May 16, 2018	This in-frame deletion of three nucleotides is denoted MSH2 c.1786_1788delAAT at the cDNA level and p.Asn596del (N596del) at the protein level. The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is ACTC[delAAT]GATG. This variant has been identified in several individuals with a personal and/or family history of Lynch syndrome-related tumors, with tumor studies in many demonstrating microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and lack of MSH2 protein expression (Liu 1996, Katballe 2002, Wahlberg 2002, Barnetson 2006, Pedroni 2007, Christensen 2008, Mueller 2009, Sjursen 2010, De Lellis 2013, Chubb 2015, DeRycke 2017). In addition, MSH2 Asn596del has been shown to segregate with Lynch syndrome-associated cancers in several families (Stormorken 2003, Ripa 2005). While functional assays interrogating MSH6/MSH3 binding and splicing produced normal results (Guerrette 1998, Auclair 2006, Tournier 2008), other studies found this variant to reduce DNA mispair recognition and binding and ATP hydrolysis, and to ultimately cause deficient mismatch repair activity, suggesting pathogenicity (Heinen 2002, Drost 2012). Additionally, the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as pathogenic based on their multifactorial likelihood analysis (Thompson 2014). MSH2 Asn596del was not observed at a significant allele frequency in large population cohorts (Lek 2016). This deletion of a single Asparagine residue is located within the Lever domain and the region of interaction with MSH6 and MSH3 (Guerrette 1998, Lutzen 2008, Kansikas 2011). In silico analysis, which includes protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, supports a deleterious effect. Based on currently available evidence, we consider MSH2 Asn596del to be pathogenic.

1757	Pathogenic	Oct 19, 2019	This sequence change deletes 3 nucleotides from exon 12 of the MSH2 mRNA (c.1786_1788delAAT). This leads to the deletion of 1 amino acid residue in the MSH2 protein (p.Asn596del) but otherwise preserves the integrity of the reading frame. This variant is present in population databases (rs63749831, ExAC 0.002%). This variant has been observed in many individuals with Lynch syndrome (PMID: 7874129, 15680406, 11772966, 20587412, 21642682, 17505997, 14574162, 8574961), and has been shown to segregate with disease in multiple families (PMID: 14574162, 7874129, 15680406, 11772966, 20587412). This variant is also known as Asn596del or N596del in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1757). Experimental studies demonstrate that the Asn596del protein is functionally impaired, with reduced ability to dimerize with MSH6, reduced ability to bind G-T mismatch DNA, and deficiency in ADP to ATP exchange (PMID: 12124176). This variant is also reported to be deficient in mismatch repair activity (PMID: 22102614). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

Also, it has been reportedÂ¬â€ to segregate in a Lynch syndrome family (PMID:Â¬â€ 7713503). This variant is also known as p.Q600Ter in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1758). Loss-of-function variants in MSH2 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 15849733, 24362816).

This variant has been observed in an individual with early onset colorectal cancer, whose tumor studies demonstrated microsatellite instability (Farrington 1998). Additionally, this variant has been reported in a family with Muir-Torre syndrome and is considered pathogenic (Kolodner 1994).

This variant was observed in at least one individual with a history suspicious for Muir-Torre syndrome. While tumor tissue from this individual was shown to have microsatellite instability (MSI-H), mismatch repair proteins were present on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (Mangold 2004). Although functional studies were inconsistent with regards to this variant's effect on the interaction with MSH6 protein, MSH2 Arg524Pro was consistently associated with defective mismatch repair (MMR) both in vitro and in cells, abolishment of the dominant mutator phenotype, deficient ATPase activity, reduced mismatch-binding in vitro and MNNG-induced chromatin-binding in cells, and decreased MMR protein complex assembly (Boyer 1995, Guerrette 1998, Clark 1999, Drotschmann 1999, Heinen 2002, Mastrocola 2010). MSH2 Arg524Pro was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Arginine and Proline differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. MSH2 Arg524Pro occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and is located within the clamp domain which interacts with MSH6 and MSH3, and stabilizes interaction with EXO1 (LÃ¼tzen 2008). In silico analyses predict that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available evidence, we consider MSH2 Arg524Pro to be a likely pathogenic variant.

The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and proline. This variant is not present in population databases (rs63751207, ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in individuals affected with Lynch syndrome cancers (PMID: 7937795, 15849733, 18931482, 26845104), and an individual affected with Muir-Torre syndrome (PMID: 15235030). It has also been shown to segregate with Lynch syndrome cancers in two different families (Invitae). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1759). Experimental studies in yeast and human cell lines have shown that this missense change affects mismatch repair (MMR) protein complex formation and impairs the MMR function of the MSH2 protein (PMID: 10469597, 7937795, 17594722, 206672385).

Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant was absent in 277144 control chromosomes. The c.1571G>C variant has been reported in the literature in at least one individual affected with Lynch Syndrome and/or Muir-Torre syndrome(Mangold_2004, Mangold_2005). These data do not allow any conclusion about variant significance. Several publications report experimental evidence evaluating the impact on protein function, including mismatch repair deficiency, mismatch DNA strand binding, and MMR complex formation. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity (Drotschmann_1999, Heinen_2002, Gammie_2007). Three clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation, with each classifying the variant as likely pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as likely pathogenic.

1760	Pathogenic	Aug 04, 2017	This deletion of one nucleotide in MSH2 is denoted c.2113delG at the cDNA level and p.Val705TrpfsX5 (V705WfsX5) at the protein level. The normal sequence, with the base that is deleted in braces, is CATT[G]TGGA. The deletion causes a frameshift which changes a Valine to a Tryptophan at codon 705, and creates a premature stop codon at position 5 of the new reading frame. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through either protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. MSH2 c.2113delG has been reported in families who meet Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome and families suspicious for Lynch syndrome (Jeon 1996, Moslein 1996, Lin 1999, Domingo 2004, Hegde 2005, Nilbert 2009, Coolbaugh-Murphy 2010). Based on currently available evidence, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.

This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed to segregate with Lynch syndrome-related cancers in several families (PMID: 8723682). In addition, this variant has been observed in unrelated individuals affected with Lynch syndrome (PMID: 18566915, 20052760, 8872463). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1760). Loss-of-function variants in MSH2 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 15849733, 24362816). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1764	Pathogenic	Dec 23, 2019	This sequence change replaces alanine with proline at codon 636 of the MSH2 protein (p.Ala636Pro). The alanine residue is weakly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between alanine and proline. This variant is present in population databases (rs63750875, ExAC 0.001%). This variant is a known cause of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, accounting for 20-30% of HNPCC in families that fulfill the Amsterdam criteria (PMID: 12454801, 21419771, 23990280). This variant has also been observed in the homozygous state in individuals with symptoms consistent with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (PMID: 19101824, 23990280). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1764) Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts the function of the MSH2 protein, rendering it defective in mismatch repair activity (PMID: 18951462, 17101317, 22102614). In addition, in silico computational models predict that this variant is pathogenic (PMID: 22949379, 22949387, 18383312). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1764	Pathogenic	Nov 01, 2018	This variant is denoted MSH2 c.1906G>C at the cDNA level, p.Ala636Pro (A636P) at the protein level, and results in the change of an Alanine to a Proline (GCA>CCA). MSH2 Ala636Pro, a founder pathogenic variant in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, has been identified in many individuals with Lynch syndrome or a family history of Lynch-syndrome related tumors, as well as in the homozygous state in individuals with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (Yuan 1999, Foulkes 2002, Guillem 2004, Lavie 2008, Toledano 2009). Tumor studies in multiple individuals with MSH2 Ala636Pro showed microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and absence of MSH2 protein expression (Ollila 2006, Toledano 2009, Kansikas 2011). MSH2 Ala636Pro was not observed at a significant allele frequency in large population cohorts (Lek 2016). This variant is located in the ATPase domain and the region of interaction with EXO1 (Lutzen 2008, Kansikas 2011). Although in silico analysis predicts that this variant does not alter protein structure/function, multiple functional assays demonstrated reduced DNA repair efficiency and partial loss of function suggesting impact on MSH2 protein folding (Yuan 1999, Foulkes 2002, Ollila 2006, Houlleberghs 2016). In addition, the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as pathogenic based on multifactorial likelihood analysis (Thompson 2014). Based on currently available evidence, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.

1775	Likely pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The homozygous p.Pro206Leu variant in SLC25A22 was identified by our study in one individual with Epileptic Encephalopathy. This variant has been identified in the literature in four affected siblings. Functional assays showed mutant functionality to be 20% of wild-type. (Molinari et al. 2005, PMID: 15592994). This variant has been identified in <0.01% (2/15258) of African chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121918334). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, this variant is likely pathogenic.

1777	Pathogenic	Jun 23, 2017	The c.1435_1438dupATCC variant has been reported previously in the homozygous state in association with 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (Kagimoto et al., 1988; Kagimoto et al., 1989; Imai et al., 1992). The duplication causes a frameshift starting with codon Proline 480, changes this amino acid to a Histidine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 27 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Pro480HisfsX27. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation. The variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). In summary, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000589608.3	CYP17A1	-
1777	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The CYP17A1 c.1435_1438dupATCC (p.Pro480HisfsTer27) variant results in a frameshift and is predicted to cause premature termination of the protein. The p.Pro480HisfsTer27 variant has been reported in one study in which it is found in one individual with congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a homozygous state (Kagimoto et al. 1988). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00003 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium, but this is based on one allele in a region of poor sequence coverage. In vitro enzyme assays with the p.Pro480HisfsTer27 variant protein showed almost total lack of testicular microsomal 17a-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities (Kagimoto et al. 1988). Based on the potential impact of frameshift variants and evidence from the literature, the p.Pro480HisfsTer27 variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, w hich alters the protein?s amino acid sequence beginning at position 480 and lead s to a premature termination codon 27 amino acids downstream. This termination c odon occurs within the terminal 50 bases of the second to the last exon and is t herefore likely to escape nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and result in a truncate d protein. In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establi sh its clinical significance, the p.Pro480HisfsX27 variant is likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PM2, PM3, PVS1_Moderate, PP1_Moderate.

1780	Pathogenic	Oct 13, 2016	The S106P missense pathogenic variant in the CYP17A1 gene has been reported previously in association with 17-hydroxylase deficiency (Lin et al., 1991; Wong et al., 2006). S106P was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The S106P variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position where amino acids with similar properties to Serine are tolerated across species, and functional studies have shown that S106P causes decreased 17-hydroxylase activity (Lin et al., 1991).

1782	Pathogenic	Jun 05, 2017	The R239X pathogenic variant has been published previously in patients who were homozygous for the R239X variant (Escamilla-Marquez et al., 2012) or compound heterozygous for the R239X variant and another variant in the CYP17A1 gene (Ahlgren et al., 1992; Paris et al., 2016). The variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Functional studies have shown R239X results in a complete loss of 17 a-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity (Paris et al., 2016).

The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in individuals affected with adrenal hyperplasia, and has been found to segregate with disease in several families (PMID: 29595516, 21340157, 17379008, 14715827). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1796). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change abrogates CYP17A1 enzyme activity (PMID: 14715827).

1802	Likely pathogenic	Dec 02, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with glutamine at codon 96 of the CYP17A1 protein (p.Arg96Gln). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894153, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been observed in several individuals affected with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (PMID: 16569739, 28008861, 26543560, 23466679, 23291414, 21846181). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1802). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. This variant disrupts the p.Arg96 amino acid residue in CYP17A1. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with CYP17A1-related conditions (PMID: 21340163, 8550762), which suggests that this may be a clinically significant amino acid residue. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product.. Truncating variants in IQCB1 are known to be pathogenic. This particular truncation has been reported in individuals affected with Senior-Loken syndrome (PMID: 15723066, 21866095, 23188109, 24625443) and Leber congenital amaurosis (PMID: 23847139, 21245082, 20881296, 21220633). Many of these individuals were homozygous for this variant. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1830). Experimental studies have shown that this nonsense change causes IQCB1 mislocalization, disrupts its protein-protein interactions, and decreases cilia formation in cultured cells by ~50% (PMID: 23446637). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1831	Pathogenic	Apr 28, 2017	The IQCB1 c.424_425delTT (p.Phe142ProfsTer5) variant is a frameshift variant that is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. The p.Phe142ProfsTer5 variant has been reported in three studies in which it is found in a total of nine individuals with Senior Loken syndrome, including in seven patients in a homozygous state and in two patients in a compound heterozygous state who both carried a null variant on the second allele (Otto et al. 2005; Estrada-Cuzcano et al. 2011; Halbritter et al. 2013). The p.Phe142ProfsTer5 variant was absent from 347 control subjects but is reported at a frequency of 0.00023 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Based on the evidence, the p.Phe142ProfsTer5 variant is classified as pathogenic for Senior Loken syndrome. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1841	Pathogenic	Aug 28, 2014	The Met1? variant has been identified in 0.012% (1/8600) of European American chromosomes and 0.023% (1/4406) of African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs80358231). The Met1? variant in MRAP has also been reported in at least 8 individuals with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (Metherell 2005). All these individuals were homozygous for the variant. This missense variant alters the evolutionary conserved initiating methionine and is predicted to lead to abnormal or absent protein. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for familial glucocorticoid deficiency with recessive inheritance.

1849	Pathogenic	Apr 21, 2015	The R299W variant in the SUGCT gene has been reported previously in several individuals with glutaric aciduria 3 who were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the R299W variant and another pathogenic variant in SUGCT (Sherman et al., 2008). All individuals with two SUGCT variants were reported to be healthy, received no treatment and remained healthy over 15 years of follow-up (Sherman et al., 2008). Additionally, R299W is identified as a variant possibly associated with an increased risk to develop an autism spectrum disorder (Matsunami et al., 2014). Functional analysis of the R299W variant (published as p.Arg336Trp due to alternate nomenclature) indicates that the variant prevents the synthesis of a soluble protein (Marlaire et al., 2014). Although not present in the homozygous state, the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project reports that R299W was observed in 58/8116 alleles (0.7%) from individuals of European ancestry, and 6/3584 alleles (0.1%), from individuals of African American ancestry, indicating it may be a rare variant in these populations. The R299W variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, occurring at a position that is conserved across species. We interpret R299W as a pathogenic variant.

1859	Likely pathogenic	Aug 08, 2016	This sequence change deletes 1 nucleotide from exon 6 of the REEP1 mRNA (c.512delC), causing a frameshift at codon 171. This creates a new translational stop signal in the last exon of the REEP1 mRNA and extends the coding sequence by 20 amino acids (p.Pro171Hisfs*52). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to delete the last 31 amino acids and replace with 51 in correct amino acids. Loss-of-function variants in REEP1 are known to be pathogenic. This particular variant has been reported to co-segregate with disease in a family affected with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PMID: 16826527). This variant is also known as c.507delC in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1859). A different variant (c.537_540del) downstream of this variant (c.512delC) that also causes a frameshift and coding sequence extension was reported to be pathogenic in an individual affected with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PMID: 18321925). In summary, this is a rare frameshift and extension that has been reported to co-segregate with disease in one family. In addition, a downstream variant resulting in a similar protein sequence change was reported in an affected individual. However, without additional genetic or functional evidence, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1861	Uncertain significance	Apr 25, 2019	The REEP1 c.*43G>T variant (rs377637314), also known as c.606+43G>T, is reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with spastic paraplegia, many of whom also had a family history of disease (Beetz 2008, Elert-Dobkowska 2015, Hewamadduma 2009, Schlang 2008, Zuchner 2006). This variant has been observed in at least one unaffected relative of an affected individual, although no neurological examination of the unaffected individual was performed (Beetz 2008). The c.*43G>T variant is found in the non-Finnish European population with an overall allele frequency of 0.14% (180/126816 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database. This variant occurs in the 3' untranslated region at a nucleotide that is moderately conserved and is predicted to alter a microRNA binding site and impact protein levels (Zuchner 2006), although functional studies would be required to confirm this. In an alternative transcript, NM_001164732.1, this is a synonymous variant, but computational analyses (Alamut v.2.11) predict that it does not alter splicing. Given the lack of clinical and functional data, the significance of the c.*43G>T variant is uncertain at this time. References: Beetz C et al.

1861	Uncertain significance	Jun 07, 2017	The c.*43 G>T sequence change has been reported previously as c.606+43 G>T in several unrelated individuals with complicated and uncomplicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, however segregation analysis was not performed for these individuals (ZÃ¼chner et al., 2006; Beetz et al., 2008; Schlang et al., 2008; Hewamadduma et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2009; McCorquodale et al., 2011; Elert-Dobkowska et al., 2015). The c.*43 G>T variant is located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the REEP1 gene at a position that is not conserved. This substitution disrupts a G:U wobble base pair, affecting the inhibitory effect on RNA-mediated repression of translation; therefore, the authors predict that the c.*43 G>T variant would lead to less available REEP1 protein, however in the absence of functional studies the actual affect of this variant is unknown (ZÃ¼chner et al., 2006). The c.*43 G>T variant is observed in 83/66706 (0.12%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic variant or a rare benign variant.	not specified	CN169374:not specified	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000252187.9	REEP1	-

ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1862). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change impairs the proper cellular localization of the REEP1 protein and interferes with the function of WT REEP1, resulting in a dominant negative effect (PMID: 24478229, 26201691, 22703882). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1880	Pathogenic	Sep 03, 2018	Variant summary: MUT c.278G>A (p.Arg93His) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalytic alpha chain of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 6.1e-05 in 277218 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in MUT causing Methylmalonic Acidemia (6.1e-05 vs 0.0024), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.278G>A, has been reported in the literature in multiple homozygous individuals affected with Methylmalonic Acidemia (Imtiaz_2014). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. The variant was reported in skin fibroblasts derived from a patient with neonatal methylmalonic aciduria, with no detectable methylmalonyl CoA mutase apoenzyme activity (Raff_1991). One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

1881	Pathogenic	Dec 02, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with valine at codon 717 of the MUT protein (p.Gly717Val). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and valine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918252, ExAC 0.09%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another MUT variant in several individuals affected with methylmalonic acidemia (PMID: 1346616, 16281286, 27233228). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1881). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change impairs MUT enzymatic activity in vitro (PMID: 1346616, 25125334). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1881	Pathogenic	May 24, 2017	The G717V variant in the MUT gene has been reported previously in association with methylmalonic acidemia when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another disease-causing variant, and is a common variant in individuals with African background (Worgan et al., 2006). The G717V variant is observed in 9/10304 (0.08%) alleles from individuals of African background, in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). The G717V variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional studies demonstrate that the G717V variant fails to constitute [14C] propionate incorporation activity (Crane et al., 1992). We interpret G717V as a pathogenic variant.

1881	Pathogenic	May 25, 2018	Variant summary: MUT c.2150G>T (p.Gly717Val) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Cobalamin (vitamin B12)-binding domain and C-terminal of the Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase domain of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 5.8e-05 in 277004 control chromosomes (gnomAD). The variant, c.2150G>T, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Methylmalonic Acidemia as a homozygous and compound heterozygous allele (Worgan_2006, Harrington_2016). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function (Worgan_2006). The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity. Three clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 and all classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

1884	Pathogenic	Jan 31, 2017	The G623R variant in the MUT gene has previously been reported in association with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) in several unrelated individuals who were homozygous for G623R or heterozygous for G623R and another variant in the MUT gene (Qureshi et al., 1994; Worgan et al., 2006; Cosson et al., 2009). This variant is reported to be a common variant in individuals of African descent and functional analysis of G623R found that it is associated with significantly reduced enzyme activity compared to wild-type (Worgan et al., 2006; Janata et al., 1997). The G623R variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore we interpret G623R to be a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000520995.4	MUT	-

1886	Pathogenic	Apr 13, 2017	Variant summary: The MUT c.655A>T (p.Asn219Tyr) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide, which is located in Cobalamin (vitamin B12)-dependent enzyme, catalytic domain. 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant (SNPs&GO not captured due to low reliability index). This variant was found in 7/120870 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0000579, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MUT variant (0.0024152). This variant has been found multiple patients with MUT-related methylmalonic acidemia. Enzyme activity in the patients who carry homozygous p.N219Y was extremely low compared to normal values (Lempp_2007), suggesting p.N219Y is damaging to MUT normal function. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

Expression studies found that N219Y abolishes methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, and patients homozygous for the N219Y mutation have the severe mut 0 phenotype (Acquaviva et al., 2001). N219Y was found at a 1% carrier frequency in a French control population (Acquaviva et al., 2001). The variant is found in MMA-MET panel(s).

1887	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 108 of the MUT protein (p.Arg108Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121918257, ExAC 0.09%). This variant has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with methylmalonic acidemia as homozygous or in combination with other MUT variants (PMID: 16281286, 17075691, 24059531, 23045948, 2661559, 22614770, 24464670, 27578510). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1887, 216966). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg108His) has been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 16281286, 25750861, 23430940, 17113806, 22614770). This suggests that the arginine residue is critical for MUT protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1897	Pathogenic	Oct 18, 2018	The BTD c.1595C>T; p.Thr532Met variant (rs104893688), is reported in the literature in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in multiple individuals affected with partial to profound biotinidase deficiency (Cowan 2012, Funghini 2002, Laszlo 2003, Norrgard 1999, Ohlsson 2010, Pomponio 2000, Swango 1998, Wiltink 2016, Wolf 2017). This variant is reported as pathogenic by multiple laboratories in ClinVar (Variation ID: 1897), and is found in the non-Finnish European population with an allele frequency of 0.015% (19/125,971 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database. The threonine at codon 532 is highly conserved, and computational analyses (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) predict that this variant is deleterious. Based on available information, the p.Thr532Met variant is considered to be severely pathogenic. References: Cowan TM et al.

1898	Pathogenic	Apr 02, 2018	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 538 of the BTD protein (p.Arg538Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs80338686, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been reported as homozygous or in combination with another BTD variant in several individuals affected with biotinidase deficiency (PMID: 9099842, 27657684, 27207447). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1898). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be disruptive, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg538Ser) has been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 22698809, Invitae). This suggests that the arginine residue is critical for BTD protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be pathogenic. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1898	Pathogenic	Sep 02, 2016	The p.Arg538Cys variant in BTD has been previously identified in at least 5 comp ound heterozygous and 2 homozygous individuals with severe biotinidase deficienc y and it is the second most common mutation in the biotinidase gene that causes profound biotinidase deficiency in symptomatic children. All these patients had no biotinyl transferase activity in their serum and <10% of mean normal biotiny l-hydrolase activity (Pomponio 1997). This variant has also been identified in 8 /114,620 of chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.b roadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs80338686); however, this frequency is low enough to b e consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for biotinidase deficiency in an autoso mal recessive manner based upon case and allelic observations and functional evi dence.

1899	Pathogenic	Dec 26, 2018	This sequence change replaces glycine with serine at codon 34 of the BTD protein (p.Gly34Ser). The glycine residue is weakly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glycine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs119103232, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another BTD variant in several individuals affected with biotinidase deficiency (PMID: 9158148, 27657684, 21752405, 25174816, 28498829, 15060693). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1899). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function output the following: SIFT: "Tolerated"; PolyPhen-2: "Benign"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0". The serine amino acid residue is found in multiple mammalian species, suggesting that this missense change does not adversely affect protein function. These predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. Experimental studies have shown that this variant disrupts mRNA splicing (PMID: 9158148). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1900	Pathogenic	Nov 09, 2013	The p.Asp444His variant in BTD has been previously identified in several individ uals with biotinidase deficiency and is predicted to lead to a ~25% reduction in biotinidase activity (Norrgard 1998). This variant has also been identified in 5.5% (1422/25788) of Finnish chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gno mAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs13078881). Although this variant is seen in the general population, its frequency is consistent with its predicte d effect. Individuals homozygous for the p.Asp444His variant are expected to ha ve approximately 50% of mean normal serum biotinidase deficiency, similar to the activity of heterozygotes for profound biotinidase deficiency. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for biotinidase defic iency in an autosomal recessive manner based upon its segregation in affected in dividuals and functional evidence, though it is considered a mild pathogenic all ele.

The aspartic acid residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between aspartic acid and histidine. This variant is present in population databases (rs13078881, ExAC 5%). In the homozygous state this variant does not cause biotinidase deficiency or partial biotinidase deficiency (PMID:Â¬â€ 28682309,Â¬â€ 9654207). However, this variant in conjunction with another pathogenic variant is a common cause of partial biotinidase deficiency (PMID: 10206677, 9654207, 12227467, 23644139).

1900	Pathogenic	Aug 08, 2018	The BTD c.1330G>C; p.Asp444His variant (rs13078881) is reported in multiple patients with partial biotinidase deficiency (Dobrowolski 2003, Funghini 2002, Milankovics 2010, Muhl 2001, Pomponio 2000, Swango 1998, Wolf 2005), with a higher prevalence in affected individuals (Milankovics 2010). This variant is reported multiple times in the ClinVar database as pathogenic (Variation ID: 1900), and found in the general population with an overall allele frequency of 3.2% (8916/277178 alleles, including 198 homozygotes) in the Genome Aggregation Database. The aspartate at codon 444 is highly conserved, and computational analyses (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) predict that the variant is deleterious. Based on available information, this variant is considered to be mildly pathogenic. REFERENCES Dobrowolski S et al.

1900	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The BTD c.1330G>C (p.Asp444His) variant has been reported as the most common variant found in newborns screened for profound biotinidase deficiency. However, in individuals with profound biotinidase deficiency, the variant is usually found in cis with one of three additional variants (Norrgard et al. 1999). In the studies by Norrgard et al. (1998; 1999), 14 of 31 children with biotinidase deficiency carried both the p.Asp444His and the p.Ala171Thr variants in cis. This double variant allele has been identified as the second most common allele in newborns screened for biotinidase deficiency. The combination of the two variants resulted in approximately 52% enzyme loss. In control populations, 23 of 296 healthy individuals were identified with the p.Asp444His variant versus none of 376 with the p.Ala171Thr variant. The p.Asp444His variant alone is reported to be the most common cause of partial biotinidase deficiency (10% to 30% of normal serum activity) when found in a compound heterozygous state with a severe pathogenic variant in the BTD gene (Swango et al. 1998). Individuals who are homozygous for the p.Asp444His variant have approximately 50% of mean normal enzyme activity (Pindolia et al. 2010). Untreated individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency are often asymptomatic in the absence of confounding factors such as significant illness. The p.Asp444His variant is reported at a frequency of 0.0758 in the Finnish population of the 1000 Genomes Project. Although this allele frequency appears inconsistent with the disease prevalence, the p.Asp444His variant appears to be a mild variant when found in trans with a severe pathogenic variant, and is only associated with severe biotinidase deficiency when found in cis with a more severe variant and in trans with a severe pathogenic variant. Based on the evidence, the p.Asp444His variant is classified as pathogenic for biotinidase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1902	Pathogenic	May 07, 2015	This patient is a carrier of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the BTD gene associated with autosomal recessive biotinidase deficiency (MIM 253260). This BTD variant (c.1374A>C) was identified in several patients in both the homozygous and compound heterozygous state, and is one of the most common pathogenic mutations identified in this gene through newborn screening programs in populations of northern European ancestry (Norrgard et al. 1997, PMID 9232193; Wolf et al. 1997, PMID: 9375914; Norrgard et al. 1999, PMID: 10400129; Pomponio et al. 2000, PMID: 10801053). Biochemical analyses of patients with this mutation have supported the role this mutation plays in causing biotinidase deficiency.

1902	Pathogenic	Aug 30, 2017	The BTD c.1368A>C (p.Gln456His) missense variant is described as one of the most common variants in individuals with biotinidase deficiency (Norrgard et al. 1997). The p.Gln456His variant has been reported in at least 16 individuals with partial or profound biotinidase deficiency including two in a homozygous state and 14 in a compound heterozygous state (Norrgard et al. 1997; Thodi et al. 2013; Wolf 2017; Borsatto et al. 2017). The p.Gln456His variant was absent from 632 controls (Norrgard et al. 1997) but is reported at a frequency of 0.00151 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. Serum from a homozygous individual showed reduced cross reacting material to a polyclonal antibody compared with serum from normal controls, and decreased or no activity of biotinyl-hydrolase and biotinyl-transferase was also observed (Norrgard et al. 1997). Based on the evidence, the p.Gln456His variant is classified as pathogenic for biotinidase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1902	Pathogenic	Aug 08, 2018	The BTD c.1368A>C; p.Gln456His variant (rs80338685) is reported multiple times in the ClinVar database as pathogenic (Variation ID: 1902), and reported to be the most common cause of profound biotinidase deficiency in children ascertained by newborn screening in the United States (Norrgard 1997). The variant enzyme in the homozygous state has very low biotinyl-hydrolase activity and lacks biotinyl-transferase activity (Norrgard 1997). Therefore, this variant is considered severely pathogenic.

1902	Pathogenic	Jul 02, 2018	This sequence change replaces glutamine with histidine at codon 456 of the BTD protein (p.Gln456His). The glutamine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glutamine and histidine. This variant is present in population databases (rs80338685, ExAC 0.07%). This variant is a well known BTD deficiency allele (PMID: 9232193). It has been reported as homozygous and in combination with other BTD variants in newborn screening positive and in symptomatic individuals (PMID: 11313766, 10400129, 10801053, 25423671, 26810761, 27329734, 24797656). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1902). This variant has been associated with profound and partial deficiency of BTD enzyme activity (PMID: 11313766, 9232193, 9654207, 23644139, 27329734, 24797656).

1903	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The BTD c.1466A>C (Asn489Thr) variant has been reported in three studies and was found in a homozygous state in one individual with 10.8% of the mean normal biotinyl hydrolase activity (Pomponio et al. 1998). This individual was also homozygous for an additional polymorphism, and each of the individual's parents was shown to be a heterozygous carrier of both variants. Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00046 in the East Asian population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The p.Asn489Thr variant is present in a well-conserved residue and is predicted to abolish a putative N-linked glycosylation site (Pomponio et al. 1998; Pindolia et al. 2010). Based on the evidence, the p.Asn489Thr variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for biotinidase deficiency.

1908	Uncertain significance	Nov 09, 2018	The HLCS c.1711G>A (p.Asp571Asn) variant has been reported in four studies and is found in a total of at least two patients in a compound heterozygous state (Dupuis et al. 1996; Aoki et al. 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Suzuki et al. 2005). Control data are unavailable for this variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00008 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Transient expression of the p.Asp571Asn variant, which occurs at a highly conserved residue in a putative biotin-binding region in transformed patient fibroblasts resulted in HCS enzyme activity of 0.1% that of the wild type enzyme (Aoki et al. 1999). Based on the evidence, the p.Asp571Asn variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency.

1909	Pathogenic	Oct 25, 2018	Variant summary: HLCS c.1522C>T (p.Arg508Trp) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) and lipoyl protein ligase (LPL), catalytic domains of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant is located at the third exonic nucleotide from a splice junction, suggesting it may impact normal splicing. 5/5 computational tools predict no significant impact on normal splicing. However, these predictions have yet to be confirmed by functional studies. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 2.4e-05 in 246292 control chromosomes (gnomAD). The variant, c.1522C>T, has been reported in the literature in multiple homozygous individuals affected with Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency (Malvagia_2005, Tang_2003, Hui_2011). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. To our knowledge, no experimental evidence demonstrating an impact on protein function has been reported. One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 4.1e-06 in 246272 control chromosomes (gnomAD). c.1648G>A has been reported in the literature in homo- or heterozygous state, in multiple individuals from several ethnic groups who were affected with Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency (see e.g. Dupuis 1996, Yang 2001, Tang 2003). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. At least one publication reported experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in <10% of normal activity, and the enzyme activity was moderately biotin responsive (Dupuis 1999). Two clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation, and both of them classified the variant as pathogenic (1x)/likely pathogenic(1x).

1912	Pathogenic	Aug 10, 2018	Variant summary: HLCS c.1519+5G>A alters a conserved nucleotide located close to a canonical splice site and therefore could affect mRNA splicing, leading to a significantly altered protein sequence. Several computational tools predict a significant impact on normal splicing: Two predict the variant weakens a 5' donor site, while one predicts the variant abolishes a 5' splicing donor site. At least one publication reports experimental evidence that this variant affects mRNA splicing, with skipping of exon 10 in vitro and in a homozygous patient cell line (Sakamoto_2000). In addition, assays for HCS activity in these patient fibroblasts revealed levels at 4% of control activity. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 6.9e-05 in 277238 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in HLCS causing Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency (6.9e-05 vs 0.0028), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. The variant, c.1519+5G>A, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency and is likely a Scandinavian founder mutation (Sakamoto_2000, Yang_2001). These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 and classified the variant as likely pathogenic.

1919	Pathogenic	Nov 14, 2017	This sequence change inserts 1 nucleotide in exon 6 of the MCCC2 mRNA (c.517dupT), causing a frameshift at codon 173. This creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Ser173Phefs*25) and is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. Loss-of-function variants in MCCC2 are known to be pathogenic.

The c.517dupT variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The duplication causes a frameshift starting with codon serine 173, changes this amino acid to a Phenylalanine residue and creates a premature Stop codon at position 25 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Ser173PhefsX25. This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

In-vitro expression studies found that E99Q is associated with no detectable 3-MCC enzymeactivity (Baumgartner et al., 2001). The E99Q variant is not observed at a significant frequency inlarge population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome VariantServer).

1923	Uncertain significance	Jul 28, 2016	The MCCC2 c.499T>C (p.Cys167Arg) variant is a missense variant that has been reported in a homozygous state in one individual with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (Gallardo et al. 2001). The p.Cys167Arg variant was absent from 100 controls. It is reported at a frequency of 0.00009 in the Latino population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium, but this frequency is based on one allele in a region of good sequence coverage; therefore, the variant is presumed to be rare. Based on the limited evidence, the p.Cys167Arg variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency.

1925	Uncertain significance	Apr 27, 2017	The MCCC2 c.1309A>G (p.Ile437Val) variant is described in two studies in which it is found in a compound heterozygous state in one individual and in a heterozygous state in another individual, both with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (3-MCC) deficiency (Baumgartner et al. 2001; GrÃ¼nert et al. 2012). The p.Ile437Val variant was not present in 100 controls (GrÃ¼nert et al. 2012) and is reported at a frequency of 0.00005 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Functional studies using RT-PCR showed that the p.Ile437Val variant activates a cryptic splice donor site, which when used results in the deletion of the last 64 base pairs of exon 14 from the mature transcript. Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR product showed that virtually all the transcript present uses the new donor site (Baumgartner et al. 2001). Based on the evidence, the p.Ile437Val variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for 3-MCC deficiency.

This variant has been observed in combination with another MCCC2 variant in an individual affected with 3MCC deficiency (PMID: 22642865). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1925). This variant has been shown to interfere with RNA splicing in fibroblasts from an individual affected with 3MCC deficiency (PMID: 11181649). In summary, this variant is a rare missense change that has been reported in the population and in an affected individual with evidence of impacting mRNA splicing.

This variant has also been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID#1929). F unctional studies support for an impact to the protein (Gallardo 2001). This var iant has been identified in 2/24024 of African chromosomes by the Genome Aggrega tion Database (gnomAD, http://gnomAD.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs119103212). Alt hough this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, althoug h additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, the p.Met325Arg variant is likely pathogenic for MCCD type 1 in an autosomal rec essive manner based upon its biallelic occurrence in individuals with this disea se and low frequency in controls.

1930	Pathogenic	Dec 18, 2018	Across a selection of literature the MCCC1 c.1155A>C (p.Arg385Ser) missense variant has been reported in at least 14 individuals with 3-MCC deficiency that were both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The variant was found in a homozygous state in three subjects and in a compound heterozygous state in 11 subjects (Gallardo et al. 2001; Baumgartner et al. 2001; Baumgartner et al. 2004; Dantas et al. 2005; Stadler et al. 2006; Morscher et al. 2012; Grunert et al. 2012; Shepard et al. 2015). The p.Arg385Ser variant was found in one of 216 control individuals and is reported at a frequency of 0.0003 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. In cultured skin fibroblasts from patients carrying the p.Arg385Ser variant, MCC activity was typically less than 10% of normal (Gallardo et al. 2001; Baumgartner et al. 2001; Stadler et al. 2006). Baumgartner et al. (2001) demonstrated that the p.Arg385Ser variant conferred no detectable MCC activity when expressed in a reference cell line, though normal amounts of the protein were detected, and Baumgartner et al. (2004) showed that the MCC activity was reduced when the p.Arg385Ser variant was co-transfected with the wild type allele, which indicated a dominant negative effect. Based on the evidence the p.Arg385Ser variant is classified as pathogenic for 3-MCC deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1930	Pathogenic	Dec 16, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with serine at codon 385 of the MCCC1 protein (p.Arg385Ser). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs119103213, ExAC 0.03%). This variant has been reported as heterozygous, as homozygous, or in combination with other MCCC1 variants in multiple individuals affected with 3 Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (PMID: 11170888, 16835865, 22642865, 25356967). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1930). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change abrogates MCCC1 enzymatic activity (PMID: 14680978, 15359379, 15868465). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1930	Pathogenic	Sep 13, 2018	The R385S variant has previously been reported in association with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (3-MCC) deficiency in several unrelated individuals who were homozygous for R385S, compound heterozygous for R385S and a second variant in MCCC1, or heterozygous for R385S with no second variant identified (Gallardo et al., 2001; Grunert et al., 2012; Shepard et al., 2014, Baumgartner et al., 2004). Functional analysis of R385S found that it is associated with significantly reduced enzyme activity compared to wild-type, and that R385S may have a dominant negative effect (Sloane et al., 2004; Baumgartner et al., 2004). The R385S variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, that may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. In summary, we interpret R385S to be a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000616769.2	MCCC1	-

1934	Pathogenic	Dec 24, 2019	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the MCCC1 gene (p.Val694*). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 32 amino acids of the MCCC1 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs119103217, ExAC 0.004%). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (PMID: 11406611, 22642865). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1934). This variant disrupts the C-terminus of the MCCC1 protein. Other variant(s) that disrupt this region (His708Glnfs*8, p.Val697Serfs*19) have been observed in individuals with MCCC1-related conditions (PMID: 16010683, 22642865). This suggests that this may be a clinically significant region of the protein. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1938	Pathogenic	Feb 20, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 1441 of the LRRK2 protein (p.Arg1441Cys). The arginine residue is moderately conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs33939927, ExAC 0.001%). This variant has been reported to segregate with Parkinson's disease (PD) in multiple families and has been reported in several PD cases (PMID: 15541309, 21538529, 24565865). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1938). In vitro experimental studies have shown that this missense affects several aspects of LRRK2 function, including increasing auto-phosphorylation activity (PMID: 21658387, 23241745, 17200152), although one study was unable to reproduce this finding (PMID: 16750377). In addition, a mouse model carrying this variant recapitulates several aspects of disease (PMID: 21494637). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1940	Pathogenic	Jan 11, 2019	The G2019S variant is the most common pathogenic substitution in the LRRK2 gene (Lunati et al., 2018). This variant is associated with approximately 5% of familial Parkinson disease cases and approximately 2% of idiopathic Parkinson disease cases (Dachsel et al., 2010). Individuals who are heterozygous for the G2019S variant have more than a 20-fold increase in risk for developing Parkinson disease (Dachsel et al., 2010). The G2019S variant is associated with reduced penetrance; penetrance for heterozygotes is age dependent, and varies in different studies, ranging from 14% to greater than 90% by age 80 years (Lunati et al., 2018). Affected individuals who are homozygous for the G2019S variant have also been reported, however, they show no difference in the severity of symptoms, age of onset, or disease progression (Kachergus et al., 2005; Latourelle et al., 2008; Dachsel et al., 2010). Lysosomal dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease, and functional studies have shown that expression of G2019S produces enlarged lysosomes and diminishes the lysosomal capacity of cells, altering the lysosome function (Henry et al., 2015). The G2019S variant is observed in 87/10144 (0.86%) alleles from individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish background and 136/276858 (0.049%) total alleles, including one homozygous individual, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The G2019S variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. We interpret G2019S as a pathogenic variant.

1940	Pathogenic	Dec 19, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with serine at codon 2019 of the LRRK2 protein (p.Gly2019Ser). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glycine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs34637584, ExAC 0.06%). This variant is clearly defined as a Parkinson's disease (PD) causative allele and is the most common known genetic cause of PD, having been observed in ~5% of familial and ~1-2% of sporadic PD cases (PMID: 18986508, 15726496, 22575234, 15680455). This variant exhibits age-dependent penetrance, with the probability of becoming affected increasing from 20% at age 50 years to 80% at age 70 years (PMID: 18986508, 15726496). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1940). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change increases kinase activity, enlarges lysosomes and impairs lysosomal function (PMID: 26251043). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1952	Likely pathogenic	Jan 22, 2019	The c.800_801delAG variant in the CABP4 gene has been reported previously in association with autosomal recessive cone-rod synaptic disorder (Zeitz et al., 2006). The c.800_801delAG variant causes a frameshift starting with codon Glutamic Acid 267, changes this amino acid to a Valine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 92 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Glu267ValfsX92. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation, as the last 9 amino acids are lost and replaced by 91 incorrect amino acids. Functional studies of the c.800_801delAG variant demonstrate a damaging effect with reduction in Ca(2+) channel availability and loss of Ca(2+) channel function (Shaltiel et al., 2012). The c.800_801delAG variant is observed in 8/111584 (0.007%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret c.800_801delAG as a likely pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV001168601.1	CABP4	-

Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Probably Damaging"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

1957	Pathogenic	Jun 30, 2016	Variant summary: The ADA c.632G>A (p.Arg211His) variant involves the alteration of a conserved nucleotide. Variant is located at the metal-dependent hydrolase domain and the Adenosine/AMP deaminase domain of the protein. 4/4 in silico tools predict a damaging outcome for this variant (SNPs&GO not captured due to low reliability index). This variant was found in 8/121106 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0000661, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic ADA variant (0.001633). This variant has been reported in many ADA deficient patients and functional studies showed that variant leads to enzyme activity deficiency. In addition, multiple reputable databases classified this variant as pathogenic. Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1957	Pathogenic	Jan 30, 2018	The ADA c.632G>A; p.Arg211His variant has been repeatedly found in patients with ADA deficiency-dependent severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), including 4 unrelated homozygotes (Arredondo-Vega 1998) and 6 homozygotes from a Romani population, four of whom were related (Baffelli 2015). It has also been reported in the compound heterozygous state, in which this variant was found along with another pathogenic ADA variant, in at least 8 other SCID patients (Arredondo-Vega 1998, Bell 2011, Engel 2007, Onodera 1998). Functional studies have demonstrated that although genes carrying this variant produce full-length mRNA, ADA protein activity is severely reduced or absent (Akeson 1988, Arredondo-Vega 1998). Reduced ADA activity is an established cause of SCID (Hershfield 2003). This variant is listed in the genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) with an overall population frequency of 0.006% (identified on 18 out of 277,060 chromosomes), and is classified as pathogenic in ClinVar (ID: 1957). Based on the available information, this variant is classified as pathogenic.

1958	Likely pathogenic	Dec 07, 2019	This sequence change replaces leucine with arginine at codon 304 of the ADA protein (p.Leu304Arg). The leucine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between leucine and arginine. This variant is present in population databases (rs199422327, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with severe combined immunodeficiency (PMID: 46025, 1284479). In at least one individual the data is consistent with the variant being in trans (on the opposite chromosome) from a pathogenic variant. This variant is also known as c.1006T>G in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1958). This variant has been reported to affect ADA protein function (PMID: 3007108). In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1959	Pathogenic	Apr 14, 2017	The A329V variant in the ADA gene has been published previously in association with ADA deficiency, including instances of apparent homozygosity (Akeson et al., 1987; Hirschhorn et al., 1992; Arredondo-Vega et al., 1998). The A329V variant is observed in 3/4406 (0.079%) alleles from individuals of African background in the ExAC dataset (Lek et al., 2016). The A329V variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved across species. However, functional studies have shown A329V results in drastically lowered protein activity compared to wild-type (Arredondo-Vega et al., 1998). We interpret A329V as a pathogenic variant.

This variant has been observed in individuals and families with adenosine deaminase deficiency and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (PMID: 2773932, 9758612, 8401541, 1346349). This variant is also known as 1081C>T in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1959). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts the catalytic activity and protein stability of adenosine deaminase (PMID: 9758612, 3475710, 3182793).

1962	Uncertain significance	Dec 01, 2017	The R76W variant in the ADA gene has been reported previously in the homozygous state or with a second ADA variant in patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency (Hirschhorn et al., 1990; Hirschhorn et al., 1992; Hirschhorn et al., 1993). This is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support a deleterious effect. The R76W variant is observed in 66/24028 (0.27%) alleles from individuals of African background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). Based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic variant or a rare benign variant.We consider it to be a variant of uncertain significance.

The variant is observed in 9/33582 (0.0268%) alleles from individuals of Latino background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). L107P is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties.

1966	Likely pathogenic	Dec 13, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with cysteine at codon 211 of the ADA protein (p.Arg211Cys). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between arginine and cysteine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121908740, ExAC 0.08%). This variant has been observed in combination with another ADA variant in individuals affected with adenosine deaminase deficiency and has been shown to segregate with disease in a family (PMID: 8051429, 2166947). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1966). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change impairs enzyme activity (PMID: 9361033, 9758612). This variant disrupts the p.Arg211 amino acid residue in ADA. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in affected individuals (PMID: 9758612, 1974554, 9414266, 26376800), suggesting that it is a clinically significant residue. As a result, variants that disrupt this residue are likely to be causative of disease. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

1966	Likely pathogenic	Nov 01, 2018	The ADA c.631C>T (p.Arg211Cys) variant was first reported by Hirschhorn et al. (1990) in a child with partial adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This patient was compound heterozygous for p.Arg211Cys and a second missense variant, and had approximately 8% residual ADA activity in lymphoid cells. The p.Arg211Cys variant was subsequently identified in a compound heterozygous state with a second deletion variant in two siblings with ADA deficiency and combined immunodeficiency, with no detectable ADA activity. The p.Arg211Cys variant was also detected in a heterozygous state in the mother, two additional siblings, and in a patient's child, all of whom had normal or below normal ADA activity (Shovlin et al. 1994). Control data are unavailable for this variant, but it is reported at a frequency of 0.00078 in the Latino population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Expression studies in COS cells by Jiang et al. (1997) showed that the p.Arg211Cys variant resulted in residual ADA activity of approximately 4% of normal. Another variant at this position, p.Arg211His, has also been seen in patients with ADA deficiency (Akeson et al. 1988; Arredondo-Vega et al. 1998). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg211Cys variant is classified as likely pathogenic for adenosine deaminase deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

1968	Pathogenic	Sep 24, 2019	This sequence change replaces glycine with arginine at codon 216 of the ADA protein (p.Gly216Arg). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and arginine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121908723, ExAC 0.003%). This variant has been observed in homozygous and compound heterozygous individuals affected with adenosine deaminase deficiency (PMID: 9108404, 9758612, 1680289, 1346349, 26255240). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1968). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts ADA protein function (PMID: 9758612, 9108404, 8258146). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1968	Pathogenic	Jul 10, 2017	The G216R missense variant in the ADA gene has been reported previously in association with adenosine adeaminase deficiency in patients of varied ancestries (Hirschhorn et al., 1991; Arredondo-Vega et al., 1998; Adams et al., 2015; Baffelli et al., 2015). It was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. G216R is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Missense variants in nearby residues (R211H/C, V213F, A215T, E217K) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with ADA-related disorders (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. In addition, functional studies have shown that the G216R variant results in reduced catalytic activity and early clinical presentation of the disorder (Arredondo-Vega et al., 1998). Therefore, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000321380.7	ADA	-

Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.0001 in 29856 control chromosomes. c.466C>T has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome. These data indicate that the variant is very likely to be associated with disease. The variant has been reported to have <10% wild-type enzymatic activity in cells expressing recombinant protein (Arredondo-Vega_1998). No clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014.

1977	Likely pathogenic	Sep 27, 2018	This sequence change replaces glycine with valine at codon 74 of the ADA protein (p.Gly74Val). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and valine. This variant is present in population databases (rs199422328, ExAC 0.01%). This variant has been observed in combination with another ADA variant in an individual affected with adenosine deaminase deficiency (PMID: 8614422). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1977). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change results in significantly reduced adenosine deaminase activity (PMID: 8614422, 9758612). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively.

1979	Uncertain significance	Aug 02, 2018	Variant summary: ADA c.454C>A (p.Leu152Met) results in a conservative amino acid change located in the Adenosine/AMP deaminase domain (IPR001365) of the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.00015 in 234900 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not higher than expected for a pathogenic variant in ADA causing Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome (SCID) (0.00015 vs 0.0016), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.454C>A has been reported in the literature in a healthy homozygous individual with partial adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency (Hirschhorn 1997). This study also reported that the variant protein had considerably less enzymatic activity than the normal, but slightly greater than that found in SCID patients, suggesting that the variant could result in disease in homozygosity when challenged by severe environmental insults or in heterozygosity with a null mutation. These data indicate that the variant may be associated with disease. No clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as VUS-possibly pathogenic.

1999	Pathogenic	Sep 27, 2018	The c.1389+1G>A pathogenic variant in the UNC13D gene has been reported previously in both the homozygous and compound heterozygous states in association with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (Feldmann et al., 2003; Nakamura et al., 2015). This splice site variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 15. It is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or to an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation. The c.1389+1G>A variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. We interpret c.1389+1G>A as a pathogenic variant.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329946.6	UNC13D	-

1999	Pathogenic	Sep 27, 2019	This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 15 of the UNC13D gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs777759523, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been reported to be homozygous or in combination with other pathogenic UNC13D variants in several individuals affected with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (PMID: 14622600, 18492689, 19704116, 21248318, 25573973). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 1999). Donor and acceptor splice site variants typically lead to a loss of protein function (PMID: 16199547), and loss-of-function variants in UNC13D are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 14622600). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

1999	Pathogenic	Apr 27, 2017	The UNC13D c.1389+1G>A variant occurs in a canonical splice site (donor) and is therefore predicted to disrupt or distort the normal gene product. The variant has been reported in six studies in which it is found in a total of ten individuals with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including two siblings in a homozygous state, seven individuals in a compound heterozygous state, and one in a heterozygous state in whom a second variant was not detected (Feldmann et al. 2003; Zur Stadt et al. 2006; Santoro et al. 2008; Wood et al. 2009; Sieni et al. 2011; Nakamura et al. 2015). The variant was absent from ten controls but is reported at a frequency of 0.00009 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Due to the potential impact of splice donor variants and the supporting evidence from the literature, the c.1389+1G>A variant is classified as pathogenic for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

2000	Pathogenic	Aug 29, 2018	The UNC13D c.766C>T (p.Arg256Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant that is predicted to result in a premature termination of the protein. The c.766C>T (p.Arg256Ter) variant has been reported in five studies and is found in seven individuals with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a compound heterozygous state (Feldmann et al. 2003; Zur Stadt et al. 2006; Nagai et al. 2010; Zhizhuo et al. 2012; Qian et al. 2014). The variant was absent from 276 control subjects and is present at a frequency of 0.000046 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Western blotting experiments showed that the p.Arg256Ter variant resulted in an absence of protein expression (Nagai et al. 2010). Due to the potential impact of stop-gained variants and the supporting evidence from the literature, the p.Arg256Ter variant is considered to be pathogenic for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

2006	Pathogenic	Dec 03, 2018	The homozygous p.Cys283Tyr variant in SGCG was identified by our study in one individual with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). This variant has been identified in 0.0008957% (1/111646) of European (non-Finnish) chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs104894422). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Cys283Tyr variant may impact protein function by disrupting sarcoglycan formation and protein localization to the membrane (PMID: 14981741, 22095924). However, these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. The p.Cys283Tyr variant in SGCG has been reported in at least 327 Spanish Gypsy individuals with LGMD, segregated with disease in 13 affected relatives from 2 families, and is believed to be a founder variant (PMID: 9781048, 20345928, 9658457, 22095924). In summary, the p.Cys283Tyr variant is pathogenic. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PM2, PP3, PS3, PP1_Strong (Richards 2015).

2006	Pathogenic	Mar 26, 2017	This sequence change replaces cysteine with tyrosine at codon 283 of the SGCG protein (p.Cys283Tyr). The cysteine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between cysteine and tyrosine. This variant is not present in population databases (rs104894422, ExAC no frequency). This variant is clearly defined as a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C causative allele (PMID: 8968757, 22095924, 9781048). It is also a well-known founder mutation in the Roma population (PMID: 10447257, 15322984). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change leads to ER retention and protein mislocalization in vitro (PMID: 22095924).

2009	Pathogenic	Jun 27, 2017	The E263K missense variant in the SGCG gene has been reported previously multiple times in association with LGMD2C (Duncan et al., 2006; DiCapua et al., 2014; Al-Zaidy et al., 2015). Immunostaining of muscle biopsies revealed absent gamma-sarcoglycan staining (Duncan et al., 2006; Al-Zaidy et al., 2015). It has been suggested that E263K is a founder mutation in the Puerto Rican population (Duncan et al., 2006; DiCapua et al., 2014; Al-Zaidy et al., 2015). The E263K variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). This variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Additionally, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. We interpret E263K as a pathogenic variant.

2009	Pathogenic	Dec 19, 2019	This sequence change replaces glutamic acid with lysine at codon 263 of the SGCG protein (p.Glu263Lys). The glutamic acid residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glutamic acid and lysine. This variant is present in population databases (rs104894423, ExAC 0.006%). This variant has been observed on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from a pathogenic variant in an individual affected with severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) (PMID: 18285821). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. Additionally this variant has been reported as homozygous in several individuals affected with LGMD (PMID: 25802879, 24534832, 16832103, 27708273).

2014	Pathogenic	Oct 19, 2017	The R589X nonsense pathogenic variant in the AHI1 gene has been reported previously as a homozygous variant in a patient with JSRD (Valente et al., 2006). This pathogenic variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Functional studies in a zebrafish model demonstrate that R589X resulted in shorter cone outer segments (Lessieur et al., 2017). The R589X variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret R589X as a pathogenic variant, andhomozygosity for the R589X pathogenic variant is consistent with a diagnosis of JSRD in thisindividual. However, this result could also be seen if the patient had one allele with the R589Xpathogenic variant and one allele that was partially missing or refractory to amplification.

2015	Likely pathogenic	Nov 26, 2019	This sequence change replaces arginine with glutamine at codon 723 of the AHI1 protein (p.Arg723Gln). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant is present in population databases (rs121434351, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with Joubert syndrome (PMID: 16453322, 26092869). It has also been observed to segregate with disease in related individuals. This variant has been reported to affect AHI1 protein function (PMID: 21623382). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data are needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.

2019	Pathogenic	Apr 24, 2014	The p.Asp173Asn (NM_001003841.2 c.517G>A) variant in the SLC6A19 gene has been r eported at least 10 individuals with Hartnup disease, 2 of whom were homozygous and 8 of whom were compound heterozygous with another SLC6A19 variant (Seow 2004 , Azmanov 2008). This is the most frequent pathogenic variant in patients of Eur opean descent (Azmanov 2007). This variant has also been reported in ClinVar (V ariation ID#2019), as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by three laboratories. In vitro studies indicate this variant causes a partial inactivation of the protein (Seow 2004, Camargo 2009). The p.Asp173Asn variant has been identified in 0.3% (384/126,562) of European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD ; http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121434346), though this frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, th is variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic for Hartnup disease in an autosomal recessive manner based on functional studies and its occurrence in individuals with this disease.

2019	Likely pathogenic	Apr 12, 2018	The D173N likely pathogenic variant in the SLC6A19 gene has been reported previously in association with autosomal recessive Hartnup disease when present in the homozygous state or when in trans with another disease-causing pathogenic variant (Seow et al., 2004). Functional studies have shown the transport activity was reduced in the D173N construct compared to wild type (Seow et al, 2004; Camargo et al., 2009). Although not present in the homozygous state, the NHLBI ESP Exome Sequencing Project reports that D173N was observed in 29/8600 alleles (0.34%) from individuals of European background, indicating it may be a rare variant in this population. The D173N variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs in the extracellular domain at a position where amino acids with similar properties to Aspartic acid are tolerated across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant likely does not alter the protein structure/function.

2022	Pathogenic	Jan 18, 2018	This sequence change replaces isoleucine with valine at codon 1028 of the CHD7 protein (p.Ile1028Val). The isoleucine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between isoleucine and valine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported to occur de novo in several individuals affected with CHARGE syndrome (PMID: 15300250, 16155193, 18073582, 20884005,Â¬â€ 21158681,Â¬â€ 22539353). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 2022). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change is not able to functionally rescue CHD7-null zebrafish embryos (PMID: 25472840). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or strengthen a splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

2022	Pathogenic	Oct 19, 2018	The I1028V missense variant in the CHD7 gene has been reported previously in association with CHARGE syndrome, including instances of de novo inheritance (Vissers et al., 2004; Janssen et al., 2012). The variant was not observed in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This substitution occurs at a position within the helicase ATP-binding domain that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Functional studies in zebrafish have shown that I1028V results in complete loss of function of the CHD7 gene (Balasubramanian et al., 2014). Missense variants in nearby residues (N1030S, W1031R/G) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with CHARGE syndrome (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.

2038	Pathogenic	Jul 21, 2015	The Q1599X nonsense variant in the CHD7 gene has been reported previously as de novo in association with congenital heart disease (Zaidi et al., 2013). The Q1599X pathogenic variant has also been reported in a parent diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome and both of his affected children (Vuorela et al. 2007). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Q1599X was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Approximately 45% of CHD7 pathogenic variants are nonsense changes predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Janssen et al., 2012; Zentner et al, 2010). Therefore, we interpret the Q1599X variant to be pathogenic.	Not Provided	CN517202:not provided	criteria provided, single submitter	clinical testing	germline:na	GeneDx	SCV000329265.6	CHD7	-

2047	Pathogenic	Jan 02, 2020	This sequence change results in a premature translational stop signal in the RDH12 gene (p.Ala269Glyfs*2). While this is not anticipated to result in nonsense mediated decay, it is expected to disrupt the last 48 amino acids of the RDH12 protein. This variant is present in population databases (rs758435713, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another RDH12 variant in several individuals affected with Leber congenital amaurosis (PMID: 23847139, 22065924, 17389517). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 2047). This variant disrupts the C-terminus of the RDH12 protein. Other variant(s) that disrupt this region (p.Arg295*) have been determined to be pathogenic (PMID: 16269441, 26047050, 22065924). This suggests that variants that disrupt this region of the protein are likely to be causative of disease. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

2047	Pathogenic	Aug 15, 2018	The RDH12 c.806_810delCCCTG (p.Ala269GlyfsTer2) variant results in a frameshift and is predicted to result in premature truncation of the protein. Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Ala269GlyfsTer2 variant has been found in at least 18 individuals affected with retinal disorders, including in 12 in a compound heterozygous state, in five in a homozygous state and in one in a heterozygous state (Perrault et al. 2004; Thompson et al. 2005; Coppieters et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2013; Boulanger-Scemama et al. 2015; Ge et al. 2015). The p.Ala269GlyfsTer2 variant was absent from at least 699 controls (Perrault et al. 2004; Coppieters et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2007) and is reported at a frequency of 0.0003 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. The functional effect of the variant was assayed by transfection in COS-7 cells, which led to undetectable levels of RDH12 expression, and a dramatic reduction in ability to produce all-trans-retinol from all-trans-retinal, as compared to wild type (Sun et al. 2007). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Ala269GlyfsTer2 variant is classified as pathogenic for RDH12-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.
